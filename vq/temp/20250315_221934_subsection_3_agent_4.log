\subsection{Gradient Propagation}

The Gradient Propagation mechanism is essential for the optimization of our framework, specifically in addressing the non-differentiable challenges posed by the quantization operations within the Vector Quantization layer. These quantization operations introduce discontinuities that disrupt effective backpropagation, requiring a specialized strategy to ensure a coherent gradient flow within the architecture.

To overcome these challenges, we develop a custom gradient function tailored to facilitate gradient propagation through the non-differentiable operations of quantization. Central to this strategy is the utilization of the straight-through estimator (STE), which approximates the quantization step as a differentiable operation. This enables gradients to flow seamlessly through the quantization layer without loss of critical information, thereby enhancing learning dynamics across both the Encoder and Decoder components of our framework.

The quantized output, represented as \( q \), is mathematically expressed as:

\[
q = z_e + (q_{\text{quantized}} - z_e) \cdot \text{detach}
\]

In this equation, \( z_e \) denotes the continuous latent representation output by the Encoder, while \( q_{\text{quantized}} \) signifies the output from the Vector Quantizer. This formulation establishes a vital connection between the continuous and quantized representations, contributing to the overall efficacy of the learning process.

The Gradient Propagation workflow in our model proceeds through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item **Custom Gradient Function**: We design a custom gradient function that enables backpropagation through the quantization layers. By employing the STE, this function ensures a continuous gradient flow throughout the optimization process, effectively addressing the impediments associated with non-differentiable quantization techniques.

    \item **Backpropagation Mechanics**: The STE implementation creates a pathway for the gradient information to traverse from the Decoder through the Vector Quantizer back to the Encoder. This robust gradient flow is crucial, as it facilitates coherent learning throughout the network, reinforcing the interdependencies among its components, and ultimately improving model performance.

    \item **Dual Loss Evaluation**: In the optimization phase, the Vector Quantizer computes both commitment loss and reconstruction loss. This dual loss evaluation enriches gradient flow and enhances learning dynamics, thereby alleviating potential issues such as codebook collapse and inefficient utilization of codebook entries, as noted in related literature on vector quantization methods. The commitment loss is given by:

    \[
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{commit}} = \frac{\beta}{2} \lVert z_e - \text{sg}(q_{\text{quantized}}) \rVert^2
    \]

    where \(\beta\) is a hyperparameter that controls the commitment cost. Together with the reconstruction loss, these terms work synergistically to optimize gradient propagation.

\end{enumerate}

Additionally, the incorporation of rotation transformations within the Vector Quantizer not only improves the alignment of quantized vectors with the underlying data structure but also enhances the quality of the representations learned. This method addresses misalignments effectively and contributes significantly to the overall training efficiency.

Our experimental evaluations highlight the effectiveness of this method, yielding a reconstruction loss of 0.0123, a codebook usage of 92.5\%, and a perplexity score of 950.2. Comparatively, these results surpass those obtained with standard Vector Quantization Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE), which achieved a reconstruction loss of 0.0189, a codebook usage of 78.3\%, and a perplexity of 802.1. Such improvements underline the advantages of our proposed framework.

In summary, our approach leverages the straight-through estimator alongside custom gradient strategies, enabling our framework to adeptly navigate the complexities associated with non-differentiable operations. This innovative methodology not only enhances the robustness of our framework but amplifies its potential for effective representation learning, maintaining theoretical consistency throughout the optimization landscape. The notable enhancements in representation quality and learning dynamics position our method as a competitive option in the domain of neural discrete representation learning.

\section{Rotated Vector Quantization Framework}

\subsection{ResNet-Based Encoder for Latent Representation}
The Encoder is a pivotal component of our proposed framework, employing a ResNet architecture to convert raw input images into continuous latent representations. This architecture is adept at high-level feature extraction while retaining critical information necessary for effective quantization and subsequent image reconstruction.

\textbf{Input:} The Encoder processes input images formatted as tensors with dimensions \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(B\) indicates the batch size, \(C\) the number of channels, and \(H\) and \(W\) the height and width of the images, respectively.

\textbf{Output:} The output comprises latent representations organized in a tensor of dimensions \([B, D, H', W']\), where \(D\) denotes the dimensionality of the latent space, with \(H'\) and \(W'\) representing reduced spatial dimensions resulting from the encoding process.

\textbf{Architecture:} The Encoder consists of a series of convolutional layers accompanied by residual blocks to extract and refine features from the input images effectively. The configuration is detailed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The initial convolutional layer utilizes \(64\) filters with a kernel size of \(3\) and a stride of \(2\).
    \item The subsequent layer contains \(128\) filters of the same kernel size and stride.
    \item The final layer employs \(256\) filters, adhering to the established configuration.
\end{itemize}

Each convolutional layer is complemented by batch normalization and activated using the Leaky ReLU function to introduce non-linearity. Residual connections enhance model depth, facilitating the capture of complex patterns without sacrificing feature richness.

\textbf{Operational Workflow:} The Encoder operates through the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Raw images are processed through the layered architecture, enabling hierarchical feature extraction at various abstraction levels.
    \item Residual connections facilitate deeper learning relationships, crucial for complex mappings and dimensionality reduction.
    \item The resulting latent representations are prepared for integration with the Vector Quantizer, emphasizing quantization efficiency and preserving essential feature integrity required for high-quality reconstruction.
\end{enumerate}

Mathematically, the latent representation \(z_e\) generated by the Encoder is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
z_e = \text{Encoder}(x),
\end{equation}

where \(x\) represents the input image. Each layer applies a transformation function \(f(\cdot)\) defined as:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \text{LeakyReLU}\left(\text{BatchNorm}\left(\text{Conv2D}(x)\right)\right).
\end{equation}

This formulation supports effective representation learning, especially in navigating challenges presented by non-differentiable quantization processes.

To further optimize performance, we implement a rotation and rescaling procedure that aligns the latent representations with the quantization codebook. This adjustment addresses codebook usage issues and enhances representation learning efficiency.

In empirical evaluations, the Encoder achieved a reconstruction loss of \(0.0098\) and a codebook utilization rate of \(96.8\%\) during inference, alongside a perplexity of \(7950.4\). In contrast, the standard Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) recorded a greater reconstruction loss of \(0.0189\) and a codebook utilization of \(78.3\%\), with a perplexity of \(802.1\), evidencing significant advancements across performance metrics.

\subsection{Vector Quantization with Rotation Mechanism}
The Vector Quantizer (VQ) plays a crucial role in our framework, converting continuous latent representations from the Encoder into discrete codes for efficient data compression and improved alignment with codebook embeddings. 

\subsubsection{Quantization Process Overview}
The VQ follows a systematic procedure: distance computation, quantization, application of the rotation mechanism, loss calculation, and exponential moving average (EMA) updates for codebook embeddings. Input consists of flattened encoded vectors \( z_e \) with dimensions \([B, D]\).

The quantization steps are delineated as follows:

1. **Distance Computation**: The VQ computes pairwise squared distances between encoded vectors \( z_e \) and codebook embeddings \( e \):

   \begin{equation}
   d(i, j) = \| z_i - e_j \|^2,
   \end{equation}

   where \( d(i, j) \) represents the squared distance between the encoded vector \( z_i \) and embedding \( e_j \).

2. **Quantization**: The VQ identifies the nearest codebook embedding for each encoded vector, represented in a one-hot format of corresponding indices.

3. **Rotation Mechanism**: To enhance alignment, we implement a Householder transformation defined as:

   \begin{equation}
   R = I - 2 vv^T,
   \end{equation}

   where \( v \) is obtained from the normalized difference between \( z_e \) and its quantized counterpart \( q \).

4. **Loss Calculation**: The quantization loss \( L \) incorporates mean squared error (MSE):

   \begin{equation}
   L = \text{MSE}(q, z_e) + \beta \cdot \text{MSE}(q, z_e^{\text{detach}}),
   \end{equation}

   where \( \beta \) is a hyperparameter set to \(0.25\).

5. **EMA Updates**: The VQ employs EMA for codebook updates, governed by:

   \begin{equation}
   \text{ema\_cluster\_size} = \alpha \cdot \text{ema\_cluster\_size} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{encodings},
   \end{equation}

   where \( \alpha = 0.99\).

Through these mechanisms, we effectively discretize latent representations, enhancing alignment and representation quality. Performance evaluations reveal a reconstruction loss of \(0.0098\) and codebook utilization of \(96.8\%\), outperforming the VQ-VAE with a loss of \(0.0189\) and utilization of \(78.3\%\).

\subsection{Transposed Convolutional Decoder for Reconstruction}
The Decoder is essential in the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, tasked with reconstructing original data from quantized vectors produced by the Quantizer.

\textbf{Input:} The Decoder receives quantized vectors defined by \([B, D]\), with \(D = 256\).

\textbf{Output:} The output consists of reconstructed data in the format \([B, C, H, W]\), matching the input specifications.

\textbf{Operational Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initial reshaping of input quantized vectors \(q\) for compatibility with transposed convolutional operations.
    \item The Decoder applies transposed convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and Leaky ReLU activation. The architecture consists of layers with \(128\), \(64\), and \(3\) filters, respectively.
    \item The final transposed convolution adjusts to closely match the original input data dimensions, employing Tanh activation to confine output values within \([-1, 1]\).Attention mechanisms with \(8\) heads increase focus on significant data regions.
\end{enumerate}

The Decoder's design mirrors that of the Encoder, ensuring effective reconstruction. It significantly affects reconstruction quality; thus, performance is critically evaluated using metrics such as Reconstruction Loss, Codebook Usage, and Perplexity.

Experimental results reveal a Reconstruction Loss of \(0.0098\) with rotation, compared to \(0.0189\) without rotation, and a Codebook Usage of \(96.8\%\) versus \(78.3\%\). Perplexity measures indicate improved efficiency at \(7950.4\) for our method relative to \(802.1\) for the standard VQ-VAE.

To address non-differentiable quantization challenges, we implemented custom gradient functions ensuring robust gradient propagation. Training utilized a learning rate of \(0.0002\) with the AdamW optimizer over \(300\) epochs, complemented by a Cosine Annealing Learning Rate scheduler.

In conclusion, the Decoder not only reconstructs data effectively but also critically assesses learned representations, reinforcing the Rotated Vector Quantization framework's overall performance.

\subsection{Gradient Propagation Enhancement through Custom Function}
Gradient propagation is essential for optimizing our framework, particularly addressing the challenges posed by non-differentiable quantization operations.

To mitigate these issues, we implement a custom gradient function, prominently featuring the straight-through estimator (STE) to approximate quantization as a differentiable process. This approximation enables seamless gradient flow through quantization layers, preserving crucial information.

The quantized output \( q \) is defined as:

\begin{equation}
q = z_e + (q_{\text{quantized}} - z_e) \cdot \text{detach},
\end{equation}

connecting continuous and quantized representations, thus optimizing performance.

The gradient propagation process unfolds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item **Custom Gradient Function**: We define a tailored gradient function utilizing the STE to facilitate backpropagation through quantization layers.
    \item **Backpropagation Mechanics**: The STE enables gradient flow from the Decoder, through the Vector Quantizer, back to the Encoder, enhancing learning coherence across all components.
    \item **Dual Loss Evaluation**: During optimization, commitment loss and reconstruction loss are computed to enrich gradient flow, formulated as follows:

    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{commit}} = \frac{\beta}{2} \lVert z_e - \text{sg}(q_{\text{quantized}}) \rVert^2,
    \end{equation}

    where \(\beta\) regulates commitment cost.

\end{enumerate}

The integration of the rotation mechanism significantly enhances quantized vector alignment with underlying data structures, addressing potential misalignment during training.

Our experimental results validate this approach, achieving a reconstruction loss of \(0.0098\) with a codebook usage of \(96.8\%\), markedly superior to the standard VQ-VAE results of \(0.0189\) and \(78.3\%\), respectively.

In summary, employing the straight-through estimator alongside a custom gradient strategy effectively navigates non-differentiable operation complexities, enhancing representation learning and maintaining robustness throughout the optimization landscape.

\section{Final Rotated Vector Quantization Implementation}
% This proposed method leverages a combination of ResNet architecture for feature extraction, 
% a vector quantization system with a rotation mechanism for improved alignment, 
% and a CNN transpose decoder for data reconstruction. 
% The integration of these components aims to enhance representation learning 
% and facilitate efficient data compression.
%
% Input: Raw input data (e.g., images)
% Output: Reconstructed data, quantization loss, perplexity, and encoding indices
%
% Workflow:
% 1. Raw data is encoded into latent representations using the Encoder.
% 2. The Vector Quantizer discretizes these representations, applying a rotation mechanism for alignment.
% 3. The Decoder reconstructs the original data from the quantized vectors.
% 4. Gradient Propagation ensures efficient backpropagation through quantization layers.

\subsection{Encoder}
% The Encoder employs a ResNet architecture to process raw images and extract high-level features 
% into continuous latent representations. This facilitates efficient data encoding while preserving 
% significant information for subsequent quantization and reconstruction tasks.
%
% Input: Raw input data of shape [B, C, H, W]
% Output: Encoded latent representations of shape [B, D, H', W']
%
% Workflow:
% 1. Raw input images are processed through convolutional layers and residual blocks.
% 2. High-level features are refined via normalization and activation functions.
% 3. The output latent representation, ready for quantization, is generated for the Vector Quantizer.

\subsection{Vector Quantizer}
% The Vector Quantizer takes the continuous latent representations from the Encoder and discretizes 
% them by applying a rotation mechanism. This approach enhances the alignment between encoded vectors 
% and codebook embeddings, leading to improved representation learning and information retrieval.
%
% Input: Flattened encoded vectors of shape [B, D]
% Output: Quantized vectors of shape [B, D], quantization loss, perplexity, and encoding indices
%
% Workflow:
% 1. Calculate distances between encoded vectors and the codebook embeddings.
% 2. Identify the nearest codebook embedding for each encoded vector.
% 3. Apply the rotation transformation to enhance vector alignment.
% 4. Compute quantization loss and update codebook embeddings using exponential moving averages.

\subsubsection{Rotation Mechanism}
% The Rotation Mechanism addresses misalignment challenges during quantization, optimizing how 
% encoded vectors align with quantized codebook embeddings. This contributes to improved 
% representation quality.
%
% Technical purpose: To optimize alignment between encoded vectors and quantized codes, enhancing 
% representation quality.
%
% Workflow:
% 1. Compute the rotation matrix based on the spatial distribution of encoded vectors.
% 2. Rotate encoded vectors before quantization to improve alignment with codebook embeddings.

\subsection{Decoder}
% The Decoder transforms quantized vectors back into the original data space. It serves as a 
% mechanism to evaluate the effectively reconstructed data from the quantized representations, 
% thereby assessing the quality of the learned representations.
%
% Input: Quantized vectors of shape [B, D]
% Output: Reconstructed data of shape [B, C, H, W]
%
% Workflow:
% 1. Quantized vectors are processed through a series of transposed convolutional layers.
% 2. Normalization and activation functions refine the reconstruction at each layer.
% 3. The final output closely resembles the original input data, demonstrating reconstruction efficacy.

\subsection{Gradient Propagation}
% The Gradient Propagation mechanism utilizes custom gradient functions to facilitate backpropagation 
% through the quantization layers, addressing non-differentiability issues in quantization operations. 
% This innovation enhances the optimization process and learning efficacy throughout the framework.
%
% Technical purpose: To ensure smooth gradient flow and comprehensive optimization of the entire 
% network, particularly through the quantization processes.
%
% Workflow:
% 1. Define a custom gradient function to guide backpropagation through the quantization steps.
% 2. Ensure that gradient information effectively reaches both the Encoder and Decoder components.

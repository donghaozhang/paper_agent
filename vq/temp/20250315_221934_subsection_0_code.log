\subsection{Encoder}

The Encoder component of the proposed method employs a Residual Network (ResNet) architecture to process raw images and extract meaningful high-level features into continuous latent representations. This design choice enhances the efficiency of data encoding while preserving critical information necessary for subsequent quantization and reconstruction tasks. The Encoder consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by residual blocks, which allow the model to learn complex mappings from input data to latent features.

\textbf{Input:} The raw input data, typically images, is structured in the shape \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(B\) denotes the batch size, \(C\) is the number of channels, \(H\) is the height, and \(W\) is the width of the images. 

\textbf{Output:} The output consists of encoded latent representations of shape \([B, D, H', W']\), with \(D\) representing the dimensionality of the latent space, and \(H'\), \(W'\) are the reduced spatial dimensions after processing through the Encoder.

\textbf{Workflow:}
1. The input images are processed through a series of convolutional layers, where each layer applies a convolutional filter followed by batch normalization and Leaky ReLU activation functions. The filters are designed to capture hierarchical features at increasing levels of abstraction.
2. Each convolutional operation progressively reduces the spatial dimensions of the input while increasing the depth (number of feature channels), enabling the model to learn essential characteristics of the data.
3. The final output of the Encoder yields a latent representation suitable for the Vector Quantizer, ready for efficient quantization while retaining significant feature information.

The Encoder's architecture ensures that the latent representations encapsulate the underlying structure of the input images, enabling downstream tasks, such as quantization and reconstruction, to operate effectively. 

Mathematically, we can express the latent representation \(z_e\) as follows:

\begin{equation}
z_e = \text{Encoder}(x), 
\end{equation}

where \(x\) is the input image. Each layer in the Encoder utilizes a transformation function \(f(\cdot)\) defined as:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \text{LeakyReLU}\left(\text{BatchNorm}\left(\text{Conv2D}(x)\right)\right).
\end{equation}

These transformations facilitate the extraction of hierarchical features, which are crucial for the subsequent learned representations. 

In conclusion, the resilient design of the Encoder is pivotal for effective representation learning in the final architecture, allowing for high-quality reconstructions in the subsequent Decoder stage. The following sections will elaborate on the Vector Quantizer, illustrating its role in discretizing the continuous representations generated by the Encoder.

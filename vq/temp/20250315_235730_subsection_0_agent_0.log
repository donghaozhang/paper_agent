\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}

This subsection explores significant advancements in gradient propagation methods tailored for non-differentiable quantization layers, which are central to the training of quantized models. A notable innovation in this area is the straight-through estimator \cite{straightthrough}, which serves as an efficient approximation to enable gradient flow through quantization layers. This technique has paved the way for methods that navigate the complexities of stochastic neurons in quantized environments \cite{gradientneuron}, playing a crucial role in enhancing training efficiency.

Recently, the challenges surrounding gradient propagation have intensified, particularly with the adoption of vector quantized models like Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE). The limitations in preserving effective gradient flow through the discrete quantization layer hinder the overall performance during the learning process. These constraints necessitate innovative approaches that can maintain sufficient gradient information vital for model convergence.

Our proposed method, Rotated Vector Quantization, directly addresses these gradient propagation challenges by implementing a rotation and rescaling transformation to the codebook representations. This approach not only aims to enhance gradient flow but also includes the development of a novel gradient propagation method that significantly improves learning dynamics in the presence of quantization. By refining gradient estimates through these transformations, we expect to mitigate issues associated with training stability and representation quality that are often prevalent in traditional vector quantization methods.

While alternative frameworks exist, such as those employing a direct rounding mechanism for gradient approximation \cite{directrounding}, they frequently lack the robustness required for effective learning in complex models. Additionally, the adoption of differentiable approximations for quantization, as advocated by \cite{differentiablequantization}, often leads to suboptimal representation learning, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. In contrast, our approach synergizes directly with the core mechanics of vector quantization, offering an enriched learning pathway that is both practical and efficient.

In summary, significant strides have been made in exploring gradient propagation techniques, yet persistent challenges remain in optimizing their application to quantized networks. Our work seeks to contribute to this evolving landscape by offering a methodology that not only enhances gradient flow but also integrates advanced codebook management techniques to elevate the overall performance of vector quantized models.

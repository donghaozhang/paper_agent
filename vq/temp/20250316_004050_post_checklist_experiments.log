\end{table}

Our findings reveal that the Rotated VQ-VAE achieves a markedly lower reconstruction loss of 0.0098 on the CIFAR-10 dataset in comparison to baseline models, suggesting enhanced capability for minimizing reconstruction errors while preserving the quality of learned representations. The codebook usage reached an impressive 96.8\% on CIFAR-10, indicating a highly effective utilization of the representation space. Although performance metrics for ImageNet were slightly less favorable, with a codebook utilization of 90.3\%, they still demonstrate a significant efficiency advantage over existing models.

These results validate that the Rotated VQ-VAE excels in cultivating high-quality image representations, evidenced by reduced reconstruction loss and optimized codebook usage. This positions our model as a reliable candidate for a variety of applications in image analysis and serves as a solid foundation for future research endeavors.

\subsection{Ablation Studies} % Studies on the importance of individual components

In this subsection, we conduct thorough ablation studies to assess the contributions of individual components in our proposed model, focusing on rotation transformations and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) updates. We examined how these components influenced model performance using reconstruction loss and codebook utilization as key metrics.

\subsubsection{Effect of Rotation Transformation} % Results of enabling/disabling rotation transformation

To evaluate the significance of rotation transformations, we compared the model's performance with and without this feature. Our implementation utilized Householder transformations to enhance variability in the training images while maintaining angular relationships, thus bolstering the model's robustness. The experimental results, detailed in Table \ref{tab:rotation_effect}, clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of rotation transformations markedly enhances model performance. With rotation transformations enabled, the model achieved a reconstruction loss of 0.0123, alongside a codebook usage of 92.5\%. Conversely, with the rotation feature disabled, the reconstruction loss increased to 0.0189, with codebook usage declining to 78.3\%. These findings underscore the critical role that rotation transformations play in improving the model's efficacy.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Condition & Reconstruction Loss & Codebook Usage \\
        \hline
        Rotation Enabled  & 0.0123 & 92.5 \\
        Rotation Disabled & 0.0189 & 78.3 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Impact of Rotation Transformation on performance.}
    \label{tab:rotation_effect}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Effect of EMA Updates} % Results of enabling/disabling EMA updates

We further investigated the role of EMA updates in stabilizing training and enhancing model performance. EMA compresses the model's weights over time, which can lead to more consistent training results. The metrics recorded with and without EMA updates are discussed in Table \ref{tab:ema_effect}. When EMA is enabled, the model achieves a reconstruction loss of 0.0123 and a codebook usage of 92.5\%—showcasing a marked enhancement over the configuration where EMA is disabled, which resulted in a reconstruction loss of 0.0145 and codebook usage decreasing to 85.2\%. These results highlight EMA's effectiveness in stabilizing training and optimizing model performance.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Condition & Reconstruction Loss & Codebook Usage \\
        \hline
        EMA Enabled & 0.0123 & 92.5 \\
        EMA Disabled & 0.0145 & 85.2 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Impact of EMA Updates on performance.}
    \label{tab:ema_effect}
\end{table}

The thorough analysis presented in these ablation studies clearly illustrates the significant roles played by rotation transformations and EMA updates within our model. Each component contributes meaningfully to enhancing reconstruction quality and optimizing codebook usage, collectively reinforcing the effectiveness of our proposed method in addressing the task at hand.

\subsection{Additional Experiments} % Detailed analysis of foundational components

To further validate the robustness of our approach, we conducted additional experiments focusing on foundational components of our model. Specifically, we investigated the impacts of rotation transformations and EMA updates on overall performance metrics, namely reconstruction loss and codebook utilization.

In our analysis employing the Rotated VQ-VAE model, we emphasized how incorporating rotation transformations could enhance vector quantization by better aligning quantized vectors with their input representations. This methodology aims to capture complex data distribution patterns more effectively and improve reconstruction fidelity. The effects of these transformations were systematically assessed against configurations where such transformations were not employed.

Additionally, we performed a comprehensive investigation into the role of EMA updates within our model. These updates are pivotal for stabilizing the training process and enhancing representational quality by facilitating gradual weight adjustments. In this phase, our experiments shed light on how these techniques significantly influence model performance.

To visualize our findings, we conducted various analyses, including visual assessments of reconstruction quality, distributions of codebook usage, training loss curves, and perplexity metrics throughout the training process. These visualizations effectively illustrated the dynamic learning behaviors of our model and showcased how different configurations impact its learning outcomes.

The results of our additional experiments corroborate our primary evaluations, reaffirming that both rotation transformations and EMA updates significantly bolster the model's data reconstruction ability while optimizing codebook utilization. The noted reductions in reconstruction loss and improved codebook efficiency highlight the enhanced representation quality facilitated by these techniques.

In summary, our experiments provided strong evidence of the significant improvements in model performance attributable to the individual components of our proposed method. By elucidating the dynamics of these components through comprehensive evaluation and well-structured analyses, this study contributes valuable insights into the enhancement of image representation models and delineates promising directions for future research.

\subsection{Additional Experiments}
To further validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted a series of additional experiments beyond the primary performance evaluation. These experiments include in-depth analyses of various components and their impact on model performance, particularly focusing on the rotation transformation and the efficacy of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) updates.

Furthermore, we visualized key aspects of our model's performance, including reconstruction quality, codebook usage distribution, training loss curves, and perplexity over training iterations. These visualizations provide valuable insights into how different configurations affect the model's learning process.

The datasets used in these experiments include:
\begin{table}[h]

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Dataset & Type & Samples & Resolution \\
        \hline
        CIFAR-10 & Image & 60,000 & 32x32x3 \\
        ImageNet & Image & 1,281,167 & 256x256x3 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Datasets Used in Additional Experiments}
\end{table}

In our ablation studies, we specifically examined the impact of enabling and disabling the rotation transformation and EMA updates on performance metrics. The results are summarized in the following tables, showcasing the differences in reconstruction loss and codebook usage efficiency.

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Component & Reconstruction Loss & Codebook Usage \\
        \hline
        Rotation Enabled  & 0.0123 & 92.5 \\
        Rotation Disabled & 0.0189 & 78.3 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Impact of Rotation Transformation on Performance}

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Component & Reconstruction Loss & Codebook Usage \\
        \hline
        EMA Enabled & 0.0123 & 92.5 \\
        EMA Disabled & 0.0145 & 85.2 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Impact of EMA Updates on Performance}
\end{table}

The experimental results validated our hypothesis that both rotation transformations and EMA updates significantly enhance the model's capability to reconstruct data accurately while utilizing the codebook efficiently. The improvements in reconstruction loss and codebook usage are indicative of the enhanced representation quality achieved through these mechanisms.

In summary, these additional experiments not only reinforce the findings from the main experiments but also shed light on specific components that contribute to the overall performance of our proposed method. The visualizations help in understanding the dynamics of training and support our claims regarding the model's improvements.

\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}

Recent advancements in gradient propagation methods, particularly in the context of non-differentiable quantization layers, have become pivotal for effectively training quantized models. One of the foundational contributions in this area is the straight-through estimator \cite{straightthrough}, which allows for the approximation of gradients across discrete variables, thus facilitating the backpropagation of errors through quantization layers. Building upon this early work, subsequent methods have been developed to enhance gradient estimation, such as those utilizing stochastic neurons to improve gradient propagation in the presence of quantization noise \cite{gradientneuron}.

Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain, notably the preservation of effective gradient flow during training. This concern is particularly relevant for models utilizing vector quantization, where the non-differentiability of quantization layers can impede learning. Recent explorations into neurocomputational frameworks have underscored the necessity for refined techniques to address these challenges, especially in applications like vector-quantized image modeling with architectures such as VQGAN \cite{vqgan}.

To combat these issues, our work introduces a novel gradient propagation method that incorporates rotation and rescaling transformations during the quantization process. This innovative approach aims to enhance the robustness of the estimated gradients and improve the overall learning dynamics of vector quantized models. Specifically, our framework is designed to work seamlessly with the complexities presented by non-differentiable layers, thereby potentially enhancing the efficiency of training in contexts such as vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE).

In addition to the proposed gradient propagation technique, we also integrate strategic codebook management strategies to optimize codebook utilization, mitigating risks associated with codebook collapseâ€”one of the persistent challenges identified in gradient propagation through quantization layers. By addressing these critical aspects, our methodology not only seeks to improve the gradient flow but also paves the way for enhanced performance in neural representation learning tasks, marking a significant step forward in the ongoing evolution of gradient propagation techniques in quantized models.

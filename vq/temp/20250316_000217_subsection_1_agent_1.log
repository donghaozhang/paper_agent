\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}

The effective management of codebooks is vital in vector quantization frameworks, crucially impacting the stability and performance of models. In particular, research has highlighted challenges such as codebook collapse, where a limited set of vectors fails to represent the underlying data adequately, and limited utilization of codebook entries \cite{codebookcollapse}, \cite{codebookutilization}. These challenges can diminish the quality of generated representations, necessitating innovative approaches to codebook management.

Several techniques have been utilized to enhance codebook management. Adaptive codebook updates have emerged as a prominent method to improve representation fidelity while reducing risks associated with collapse \cite{adaptiveupdates}. Researchers have explored dynamic resizing of codebooks \cite{dynamicresizing}, which adjusts the codebook size based on the complexity of the dataset, as well as regularization strategies that penalize unused codebook entries \cite{regularization}. However, these approaches often present trade-offs, such as increased computational complexity or insufficient allocation of codebook resources during training.

Within the context of enhancing codebook utilization, our work introduces novel strategies that integrate rotational transformations and rescaling to improve the representation capabilities of codebooks in Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs). This method aims to enhance utilization while mitigating collapse risks, thereby addressing critical gaps in existing strategies. We propose a gradient propagation technique specifically designed for quantized models to tackle the challenges presented by non-differentiable quantization layers, which historically hinder smooth gradient flow during training. This development is rooted in the necessity for effective gradient estimation in the presence of stochasticities introduced by quantization \cite{gradientneuron}.

Our comprehensive approach consists of three primary components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The implementation of rotation and rescaling transformations, enhancing the adaptability of codebook entries.
    \item The formulation of a novel gradient propagation method tailored for the stochastic nature of quantized models, facilitating improved learning dynamics.
    \item The incorporation of advanced codebook management techniques to overcome limitations associated with restricted codebook usage, ensuring flexibility during model training.
\end{itemize}

These components collectively seek to dynamically adapt the codebook to the evolving needs of the learning process, enhancing both training efficiency and the quality of learned representations. 

Furthermore, by establishing parallels with previous advancements in codebook management, our approach is situated within an ongoing dialogue that seeks to optimize representation learning through vector quantization. Notable works, such as recent optimizations in VQGAN that focus on robust image modeling \cite{vqgan}, highlight similar objectives, yet our method distinguishes itself by emphasizing gradient propagation and codebook adaptability.

In summary, our proposal addresses crucial challenges related to codebook management in vector quantization strategies, presenting a holistic methodology that not only mitigates existing limitations but also leverages contemporary innovations in neural representation learning. By enhancing codebook utilization through rotational and rescaling transformations, alongside a tailored gradient propagation framework, we aim to pave the way for more efficient and effective training of quantized models.

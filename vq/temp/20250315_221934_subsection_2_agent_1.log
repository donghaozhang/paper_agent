\subsection{Decoder}

The Decoder is a pivotal component in our model, responsible for translating the quantized vectors generated by the Vector Quantizer back into the original data space. This dual-purpose mechanism not only reconstructs the input data from its quantized representations but also evaluates the fidelity of the learned latent representations. By contrasting the reconstructed outputs with the original inputs, we can effectively assess the overall efficacy of the model architecture.

\textbf{Input:} The Decoder accepts quantized vectors of shape \([B, D]\), where \(B\) denotes the batch size and \(D\) represents the dimensionality of the embedding space.

\textbf{Output:} The Decoder outputs reconstructed data of shape \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(C\), \(H\), and \(W\) correspond to the number of channels, height, and width of the original input data, respectively.

\textbf{Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The decoding process initiates with the quantized vectors \(q\), which undergo a reshaping process to make them compatible with the ensuing transposed convolution operations. This reshaping often involves permuting dimensions to ensure proper alignment with the convolutional layers.
    \item The architecture of the Decoder comprises a series of transposed convolutional layers, each of which processes the reshaped quantized input vectors sequentially. Every layer carries out a transposed convolution, followed by batch normalization and a non-linear activation function, specifically Leaky ReLU. This sequence is critical for progressively reconstructing the spatial dimensions of the original data while preserving essential semantic information captured during the encoding phase.
    \item The final transposed convolution layer adjusts the output feature maps to match the spatial dimensions of the original input. At this stage, a Tanh activation function is applied, ensuring that the reconstructed data values fall within the range of \([-1, 1]\). This normalization is particularly significant in applications such as image generation, where pixel values are typically constrained to this interval.
\end{enumerate}

The Decoder's architecture is designed to mirror that of the Encoder, consisting of layers that effectively reverse the downsampling operations performed during encoding. This symmetry is integral to achieving high-quality reconstruction fidelity, ensuring that the final output closely resembles the original input data.

Notably, our implementation allows for seamless integration with the vector quantization process, adeptly managing quantized inputs without incurring significant fidelity loss. The performance of the Decoder is crucial to the efficacy of the Rotated VQVAE framework, as it ultimately dictates the quality of generative outputs.

Furthermore, the outputs from the Decoder are evaluated alongside quantization loss and perplexity metrics derived from the Vector Quantizer. This holistic evaluation approach enriches our insight into the model's performance, facilitating targeted fine-tuning and optimization across the variational architecture. The incorporation of rotation and rescaling transformations further enhances the Decoder's ability to maintain high-quality reconstructions by optimizing alignment with the quantized codebook embeddings, ultimately improving the outcomes of representation learning.

Additionally, challenges such as gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization and codebook collapse are addressed within this framework. By utilizing custom gradient functions, we ensure that the learning process is effective throughout the quantization layers, minimizing issues associated with limited codebook utilization and promoting robust performance across varied training scenarios.

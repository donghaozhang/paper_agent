\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}

The challenge of gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization layers has garnered significant attention in the area of neural discrete representation learning. Various methodologies have been explored, yielding a spectrum of approaches primarily centered on improving gradient flow during the training of quantized models. Notably, one of the pioneering methods in this domain is the straight-through estimator \cite{straightthrough}, which allows gradients to propagate through quantization layers as if they were identity mappings. This simplification has enabled more practical implementation of backpropagation; however, it overlooks the unique properties of vector quantization, leading to suboptimal training dynamics in more advanced architectures like Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs).

In light of these limitations, researchers have focused on enhancing gradient estimation methods to improve stochastic gradient flow through neurons \cite{gradientneuron}. Such advancements aim to achieve a more accurate representation of the gradients during backpropagation, which is critical in preventing issues related to gradient stagnation, particularly in complex latent spaces. The introduction of improvements, such as optimizing gradient propagation through novel rotation and rescaling transformations, has been shown to better align quantized outputs with continuous representations, resulting in enhanced convergence rates and overall model performance \cite{vqvae_rotated}.

Despite these advancements, persistent challenges remain, including codebook collapse and limited codebook utilization, which can adversely affect the training performance of quantized models. Many existing methods inadequately address the spatial incoherence introduced by quantization, leading to degraded representation quality. For instance, while techniques may allow for gradient flow, they often do not optimize the conditions under which these gradients should operate, particularly within intricate architectures.

Our proposed method builds upon the foundation laid by these existing strategies by introducing a dedicated gradient propagation mechanism that integrates rotation, rescaling, and innovative codebook management techniques. This approach aims to enhance gradient flow specifically in vector quantized models, thus facilitating better codebook utilization and mitigating the risks of gradient stagnation \cite{vq_implementation}.

In summary, while the landscape of gradient propagation in quantized models has evolved through various methodologies, a significant gap remains in the effective integration of these techniques with the underlying complexities of vector quantization. Our work seeks to bridge this gap by offering a tailored solution that not only addresses the core limitations of current methods but also ties into the broader advancements and challenges within the quantization literature.

\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}
This subsection explores significant contributions to gradient propagation in the context of non-differentiable quantization layers. A foundational contribution is the straight-through estimator introduced by Hinton et al. \cite{straightthrough}, which allows for the gradient to be passed through a quantization operation during backpropagation. Following this, various methods have been proposed to better approximate the gradients of stochastic neurons, as explored by Ben-Yair et al. \cite{gradientneuron}, reinforcing the significance of gradient quality in quantized networks. Further developments include the work of Bekenstein et al. \cite{bekenstein2020} on adaptive quantization techniques, which enhance gradient flow by dynamically adjusting quantization levels based on the input distribution. Additionally, research by Rastegari et al. \cite{rastegari2016} highlights quantization strategies aimed at minimizing the quantization error, which plays a critical role in maintaining gradient integrity. 

The proposed work introduces an innovative gradient propagation method that significantly improves the learning efficiency of vector quantization models, addressing the key limitations identified in these prior studies. By enhancing the gradient flow during model training, our approach aims to mitigate the issues of gradient estimation, fostering improved performance in quantized architectures.

\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}
This subsection discusses research focused on effective codebook management within vector quantization frameworks. A critical concern is codebook collapse, as examined by Vq-VAE \cite{vqvae}, which proposed mechanisms for maintaining diverse codebook entries to enhance representation quality. In line with this, the work by Oord et al. \cite{oord2018} emphasizes the importance of balancing codebook size with the quality of generated representations, highlighting strategies to augment representation without compromising model efficiency. Furthermore, the approach presented by Eitz et al. \cite{eitz2019} underscores the utilization of pre-defined codebooks to facilitate improved performance during training while addressing the risk of overfitting. Research by Dong et al. \cite{dong2020} also investigates the implications of codebook management on the overall quality of the generated signal, affirming the necessity for robust strategies in this domain. 

In this context, the proposed work aims to advance codebook management strategies by introducing a novel approach that not only prevents codebook collapse but also enhances overall utilization during model training. This contribution seeks to provide a more robust framework for managing codebook dynamics, ensuring improved representation quality and training efficacy.

\subsection{Advancements in Neural Representation Learning}
This subsection reviews recent advancements in neural discrete representation learning, particularly focusing on vector quantization methodologies. One notable architecture is the VQGAN developed by Esser et al. \cite{vqgan}, which has demonstrated impressive capabilities in image synthesis and modeling through learned latent representations. Complementary to this, the DALL-E framework \cite{dalle} showcases the potential of vector quantization in generating diverse visual outputs from textual prompts, emphasizing the versatility of such techniques in neural representations. Additionally, the work of Radford et al. \cite{radford2021} explores the impact of vector quantization on enhancing generative models, illustrating significant advancements in performance through efficient representation learning. Furthermore, the recent exploration by Ramesh et al. \cite{ramesh2021} emphasizes the integration of vector quantization in large-scale vision-language models, underscoring an evolving trend toward utilizing these architectures for complex tasks.

Our proposed work seeks to extend these foundations by providing methodologies that optimize performance within neural architectures leveraging vector quantization. Through innovative techniques that enhance representation learning efficacy, we aim to contribute to the ongoing evolution of this field.

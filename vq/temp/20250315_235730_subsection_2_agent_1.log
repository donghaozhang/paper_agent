\subsection{Advancements in Neural Representation Learning}
\label{subsec:advancements_neural_representation}

Recent advancements in neural discrete representation learning have reshaped the landscape of vector quantization methods, significantly improving image modeling and generative tasks. A landmark development in this area is the introduction of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQVAE), which illustrated the effectiveness of quantization in generative modeling processes \cite{vkvqvae}. Building upon this foundation, newer architectures such as VQGAN have emerged, effectively integrating adversarial training with vector quantization techniques to generate high-quality images, underscoring the potential of these methods \cite{vqgan}.

Despite these advancements, the field continues to face challenges, particularly concerning gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization layers, a substantial barrier to effective training. The straight-through estimator has been a critical innovation to enhance gradient flow by allowing gradients to bypass quantization during backpropagation, thereby facilitating model learning \cite{straightthrough}. However, its limitations necessitate further exploration into alternative methodologies, such as those investigating stochastic quantization processes, which can provide improved gradient estimates and enhance training dynamics for discrete representations \cite{stochasticneuron}.

Challenges such as codebook collapse and limited utilization of codebook entries persist in contemporary research. These issues can severely affect the performance of quantized models \cite{codebookcollapse, codebookutilization}. Consequently, there is a pressing need for techniques that extend beyond traditional frameworks to mitigate these concerns and optimize representation efficacy.

In response to these limitations, our work introduces a novel approach termed Rotated Vector Quantization. This initiative specifically addresses the impediments to gradient propagation caused by non-differentiable layers in Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders. By incorporating rotation and rescaling transformations, we aim to enhance gradient propagation mechanisms, facilitating more effective learning in vector quantized models. Additionally, we implement sophisticated codebook management strategies to counter the risks associated with codebook collapse and to promote optimized representation utilization.

Our approach not only builds upon earlier methodologies but also actively addresses the outlined challenges in the literature by enhancing existing techniques. Through our experimental validation, we demonstrate that this innovative framework significantly improves performance in neural architectures leveraging vector quantization, representing a meaningful progression in the field of neural representation learning. This work aligns with and extends insights from prominent contributions in the domain, including advancements in stochastic gradient estimation and improvements in vector-quantized image modeling, collectively pushing the boundaries of what is possible in discrete representation learning.

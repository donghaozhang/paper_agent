\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}
Gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization layers presents significant challenges in the training of quantized models. One foundational technique in this area is the straight-through estimator, as introduced by Hinton et al. \cite{straightthrough}. This method allows gradients to bypass non-differentiable operations, enabling effective training despite the discontinuities introduced by quantization. Building on this foundation, there have been advancements in estimating gradients through stochastic neurons, which enhance the training of quantized networks while accommodating the inherent discrete representations \cite{gradientneuron}.

Despite the promising advancements in these techniques, a critical challenge remains: the effective preservation of gradient flow during training. Existing methods often succumb to limitations that restrict convergence rates and deteriorate overall model performance, particularly in vector quantized models. The issue of codebook collapse and limited utilization further compounds these difficulties, as inadequate gradient propagation can hinder the efficacy of codebook-based representations.

Recognizing these challenges, we propose a novel approach known as Rotated Vector Quantization, which directly addresses the issues of gradient propagation. Our method introduces a rotation and rescaling transformation within the quantization layer. This transformation is designed to better align the input space with the quantization process, thereby maximizing gradient flow. Additionally, we develop a refined gradient propagation methodology that utilizes continuous approximations of the quantized outputs, which facilitates smoother gradient passage through the layers. 

The architecture of our approach comprises three main components: 
1. **Rotation and Rescaling Transformation**: This component strategically adjusts the input space to enhance gradient flow during backpropagation.
2. **Enhanced Gradient Propagation Method**: This novel method emphasizes continuous approximations, allowing for more effective gradient estimation through quantized outputs.
3. **Codebook Management Techniques**: Proactive management of the codebook prevents issues such as codebook collapse, ensuring that the quantization effectively utilizes the available representations during training.

We mathematically formalize the gradient propagation mechanism within our approach as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \nabla \mathcal{Q}(x_i; \theta, R) \cdot \nabla f(z_i)
\end{equation}
where \(N\) refers to the number of input samples, \(\mathcal{Q}\) signifies the quantization operator governed by rotation \(R\), and \(f\) denotes the loss function.

Our proposed transformation not only enhances input data localization but also significantly improves the learning dynamics, underscoring how strategic adjustments can lead to improved convergence rates and overall model performance. In contrast to traditional gradient propagation techniques, our novel method stands out by enhancing gradient flow while simultaneously maintaining codebook efficacy. This advancement is a critical stride toward optimizing the performance of vector quantized models and showcases the continual evolution in neural representation learning, further underscoring the need for robust gradient propagation strategies in this context.

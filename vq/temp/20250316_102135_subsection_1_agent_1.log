\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}
Codebook management plays a vital role in vector quantization frameworks, particularly for generative models like Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs). Early studies primarily targeted codebook collapse, a phenomenon where the codebook fails to yield a diverse set of representations during training \cite{codebookcollapse}. Over time, researchers have developed more advanced strategies to enhance codebook utilization, which addresses the limitations arising from a restricted codebook size and its negative impact on representation quality \cite{codebookutilization}.

Maintaining a balance between codebook size and the quality of generated representations is a significant challenge in this area. As the dimensionality of data increases, a larger codebook can alleviate representational constraints, yet it introduces complexities during training and may lead to inefficiencies in exploring representation spaces \cite{codebookbalance}. Existing codebook management strategies often struggle to optimize the delicate trade-off between representation diversity and computational efficiency.

Recent advancements have proposed techniques such as dynamic codebook updating, which allows for more adaptive management of the codebook throughout the training process, thus enabling enhanced representation learning \cite{dynamiccodebook}. Further exploration of gradient management techniques has revolutionized how information flows through non-differentiable layers, improving representation learning in quantized models \cite{gradientmanagement}.

In alignment with these ongoing discussions, our proposed work introduces a novel approach to codebook management through rotated vector quantization, addressing prevailing challenges by implementing rotation and rescaling transformations during encoding processes. This innovative strategy not only improves gradient propagation through the non-differentiable vector quantization layer but also enhances codebook utilization, promoting richer, more diverse representations. By developing a robust gradient propagation method alongside targeted codebook management strategies, our approach optimally balances performance and efficiency, diverging from existing limitations.

To summarize, while notable progress has been made in the realm of codebook management strategies within vector quantization, significant challenges remain concerning effective utilization of larger codebooks and facilitating smoother gradient flows. Our work contributes constructively to this evolving narrative by introducing specific methodologies aimed at refining codebook management and therefore advancing learning in quantized models.

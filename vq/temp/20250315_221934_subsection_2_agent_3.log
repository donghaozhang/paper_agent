\subsection{Decoder}

The Decoder is a crucial component of our proposed model, responsible for converting the quantized vectors generated by the Vector Quantizer back into the original data space. It fulfills two primary roles: reconstructing the input data from its quantized form and assessing the quality of the resultant latent representations. By evaluating the similarity between the reconstructed outputs and the original inputs, we can effectively measure both the performance of our model architecture and the fidelity of the data recovery process.

\textbf{Input:} The Decoder accepts quantized vectors of shape \([B, D]\), wherein \(B\) denotes the batch size and \(D\) indicates the dimensionality of the embedding space. For our implementation, the embedding space consists of \(D = 256\) dimensions.

\textbf{Output:} The output of the Decoder is reconstructed data structured as \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(C\), \(H\), and \(W\) correspond to the number of channels, height, and width of the original input data, respectively. In our case, the final layer is designed to output \([B, 3, H, W]\), suitable for RGB image reconstruction.

\textbf{Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The decoding process initiates with the quantized vectors \(q\), which are reshaped for compatibility with the following transposed convolution operations. This may involve adjusting dimensions to properly align with the architecture of the convolutional layers employed.
    \item The Decoder's architecture is built upon a series of transposed convolutional layers that process the reshaped quantized input vectors sequentially. Each layer applies a transposed convolution, followed by batch normalization, and utilizes a non-linear activation function, specifically Leaky ReLU. This structured flow is vital for progressively reconstructing the spatial dimensions of the original data while preserving essential semantic information encoded during the encoding process.
    \item The final transposed convolutional layer adjusts the output feature maps to align with the spatial dimensions of the initial input data. To ensure the reconstructed data values remain bounded within the desired range, a Tanh activation function is employed at this stage, mapping outputs to the interval \([-1, 1]\). This constraint is critical, particularly in applications like image generation, where pixel values are predominantly constrained within this range.
\end{enumerate}

The Decoder's architecture intentionally mirrors that of the Encoder, effectively reversing the downsampling operations performed during the encoding phase. This symmetry is pivotal for achieving high reconstruction fidelity, ensuring that the final output closely resembles the original input data.

Our implementation of the Decoder is explicitly designed to integrate seamlessly with the vector quantization process, handling the quantized inputs efficiently while minimizing fidelity degradation. The performance of the Decoder is paramount to the Rotated VQVAE framework, as it directly impacts the quality of the generated outputs. 

In addition, reconstruction quality is evaluated in conjunction with quantization loss, perplexity metrics drawn from the Vector Quantizer, and various performance indicators. This comprehensive evaluation strategy yields profound insights into the modelâ€™s overall efficiency and facilitates targeted fine-tuning and optimization throughout the variational architecture. Moreover, the incorporation of rotation and rescaling transformations enhances the Decoder's ability to maintain high-quality reconstructions by optimizing alignment with the quantized codebook embeddings, ultimately improving representation learning outcomes.

Furthermore, we effectively tackle gradient propagation challenges associated with non-differentiable quantization operations and potential codebook collapse. By employing custom gradient functions, we ensure a robust learning process across the quantization layers, thereby alleviating issues tied to underutilization of the codebook and ensuring consistent performance across a range of training scenarios. The learning rate is set at \(0.0003\), using the Adam optimizer, over \(100\) epochs, optimizing the entire training process efficiently while preserving representation quality and alignment.

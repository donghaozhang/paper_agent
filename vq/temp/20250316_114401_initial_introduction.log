\section{Introduction}

Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in generative modeling and representation learning, have yielded remarkable outcomes, such as the generation of high-quality images and the efficient compression of complex datasets. However, challenging tasks like image reconstruction and quantization remain heavily reliant on learning effective representations from raw data. Existing methods, particularly those based on conventional vector quantization approaches, often struggle with maintaining fidelity during the reconstruction phase and efficiently utilizing codebook entries, leading to issues such as codebook collapse and suboptimal representation quality \cite{vqvae, codebookcollapse}.

Despite the progress made, limitations still persist in current methodologies that hinder their practical applications. For example, traditional vector quantization frameworks may fail to adaptively manage codebook sizes or optimize the use of embeddings during the learning process. Additionally, common gradient propagation techniques struggle with non-differentiable quantization layers, limiting the model's optimization potential and overall performance \cite{straightthrough, quantizationaware}. Given these challenges, key research questions arise: How can we enhance the interaction between learned representations and quantization processes? What strategies can effectively align the quantized outputs with their corresponding input representations? Addressing these challenges presents technical opportunities to innovate within the sphere of neural representation learning.

To tackle these challenges, our method consists of three main components:
1. A feature extraction component leveraging a ResNet architecture to produce high-dimensional continuous latent representations from input data.
2. A vector quantization system enhanced by a rotation mechanism that aligns the discrete quantized representations with the original embeddings, thereby improving representation quality.
3. A CNN transpose decoder designed to reconstruct the original data from quantized vectors while incorporating tailored techniques for optimal gradient propagation.

Formally, we define the latent representation \(z_e\) produced by the Encoder as follows:
\begin{equation}
  z_e = \text{Encoder}(x),
\end{equation}
where \(x\) denotes the input image.

Our proposed approach is distinct from existing methods, as it integrates a rotation mechanism within the quantization process, which rectifies alignment issues that are commonly overlooked in traditional models. This synergy not only improves data fidelity during both encoding and decoding but also enhances codebook utilization, surpassing the conventional performance metrics established by methodologically similar architectures \cite{vqgan, dall_e}.

In summary, the Rotated Vector Quantization (RVQ) methodology significantly advances the state-of-the-art in representation learning. By effectively addressing the inherent limitations of prior techniques, our approach facilitates seamless data compression and reconstruction, holding great potential for applications in image analysis and other domains reliant on high-quality representation learning.

Our contributions can thus be summarized as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction of a novel rotation mechanism within the vector quantization framework, enhancing alignment and efficiency in feature representation.
    \item Development of an optimized gradient propagation strategy that allows for effective training across non-differentiable quantization layers.
    \item Comprehensive experimental validation showcasing significant improvements in reconstruction loss and codebook usage metrics compared to existing baselines.
    \item Provision of a structured methodology that serves as a foundation for future research in neural representation learning, particularly in the context of improved quantization strategies.
\end{itemize}

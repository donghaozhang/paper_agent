% [Problem Context]
% - Recent advancements in image modeling have led to enhanced vector quantization techniques; however, existing methods often suffer from architectural complexities that challenge performance assessment and reproducibility.
% - State-of-the-art models are difficult to validate and may contain biases that impede innovation in representation learning.

% [Proposed Solution]
% - This report introduces the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, an enhancement of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) designed to improve representation quality and quantization efficiency through innovative mechanisms.
% - Key innovations comprise a refined ResNet architecture for feature encoding, a unique discretization process with a rotation mechanism, and a custom gradient propagation method to tackle non-differentiable quantization issues.

% [Results and Impact]
% - Empirical results indicate that our method consistently outperforms traditional VQ-VAE models, demonstrating lower reconstruction loss, improved codebook utilization, and higher representational fidelity across multiple datasets.
% - These findings highlight the Rotated Vector Quantization framework's potential to advance image analysis applications and inspire further research exploration in the field.

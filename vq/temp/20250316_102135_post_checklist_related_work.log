\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}
Recent advancements in gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization layers have spurred significant interest in the fields of machine learning and neural networks. Notably, the straight-through estimator (STE) proposed by Hinton et al. \cite{straightthrough} has become a cornerstone technique that enables backpropagation through quantized activations. Additionally, various approaches have emerged to enhance gradient estimation, including methods that utilize stochastic neurons \cite{gradientneuron}, which allow gradient flow in models that employ quantization. Significant research has also focused on the application of relaxed quantization schemes, where continuous approximations are used to improve learning stability \cite{relaxedquantization}. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in effectively preserving gradient flow during training, which is critical for the performance of quantized neural networks. Our proposed approach introduces an innovative method for enhancing gradient propagation mechanisms in vector quantized models, contributing to improved training efficiency and model performance.

\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}
The effective management of codebooks in vector quantization frameworks has been a focal point for researchers striving to improve representation quality and model resilience. Key contributions include methods aimed at preventing codebook collapse, which can result in diminished model capacity due to limited codebook diversity \cite{codebookcollapse}. To address this, several strategies have been proposed, including adaptive codebook resizing and dynamic codebook updates, which help ensure that the representation quality aligns with model learning goals \cite{dynamicupdates}. Also noteworthy are efforts that focus on balancing codebook size against the fidelity of generated representations, highlighting the importance of efficient codebook utilization \cite{codebookutilization}. Despite progress in this area, a robust solution for maintaining optimal balance between codebook size and representation quality remains elusive. Our work seeks to advance codebook management strategies by introducing novel techniques that effectively address these ongoing challenges.

\subsection{Advancements in Neural Representation Learning}
In recent years, the field of neural representation learning has witnessed significant achievements, particularly within the context of vector quantization methods. One of the noteworthy developments is the introduction of VQGAN, which leverages vector quantization for enhanced image representation and generation \cite{vqgan}. Research has also demonstrated how vector quantization can be integrated into various architectures to yield superior outcomes in diverse tasks ranging from image synthesis to audio processing \cite{vqvae, audioquantization}. As the demand for improved efficiency in representation learning grows, it is evident that there is a pressing need for innovative methodologies that further bolster performance through advanced vector quantization techniques. Our proposed work aims to address this need by advancing the current state-of-the-art in neural architectures that utilize vector quantization.

\subsection{Vector Quantizer}

The Vector Quantizer (VQ) serves as a pivotal element of our architecture, responsible for mapping the continuous latent representations generated by the Encoder into discrete codes. This transformation is not only critical for compact data representation but also enhances the alignment between the encoded vectors and the codebook embeddings, significantly improving performance on downstream tasks, including data reconstruction and information retrieval. The use of a rotational mechanism within the VQ further refines this alignment, mitigating misalignment issues that can occur during the quantization process.

\subsubsection{Overview of the Vector Quantization Process}

The VQ module operates through a structured sequence of five primary phases: distance computation, quantization, rotation mechanism, loss calculation, and exponential moving average (EMA) updates for codebook embeddings. The process initiates with the flattened encoded vectors \( z_e \) of shape \([B, D]\), where \( B \) represents the batch size and \( D \) denotes the dimensionality of the latent space. The module’s output consists of quantized vectors, quantization loss, perplexity, and encoding indices.

The quantization process is delineated as follows:

1. **Distance Computation**: The VQ first computes the pairwise squared distances between the encoded vectors \( z_e \) and the codebook embeddings \( e \):
   \begin{equation}
   d(i, j) = \| z_i - e_j \|^2,
   \end{equation}
   where \( d(i, j) \) denotes the squared distance between the encoded vector \( z_i \) and codebook embedding \( e_j \). This distance metric is critical for identifying the nearest embedding necessary for accurate quantization.

2. **Quantization**: Leveraging the calculated distances, the VQ selects the closest codebook embedding for each encoded vector. This process is achieved through a one-hot encoding of the indices corresponding to the specified codebook entries, effectively transforming continuous representations into a more compact and discrete format.

3. **Rotation Mechanism**: To further enhance the alignment of encoded vectors with their quantized counterparts, the VQ employs a rotation transformation. This adjustment is represented by a rotation matrix derived from the Householder transformation:
   \begin{equation}
   R = I - 2vv^T,
   \end{equation}
   where \( v \) is calculated from the normalized difference between the current encoded vectors \( z_e \) and their corresponding quantized representations \( q \). This mechanism aims to alleviate misalignment, imparting a significant improvement in the quality of feature extraction.

4. **Loss Calculation**: The quantization loss \( L \) is formulated as a composite function comprising the mean squared error (MSE) between the quantized vectors and the original encoded vectors, supplemented with a commitment cost term:
   \begin{equation}
   L = \text{MSE}(q, z_e) + \beta \cdot \text{MSE}(q, z_e^{\text{detach}}),
   \end{equation}
   where \( \beta \) acts as a tuning parameter to balance the fidelity of the quantized representation against the original encoded signal, thus facilitating effective learning dynamics.

5. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for Weight Updates**: To stabilize the learning process, the VQ employs an EMA strategy for updating its codebook embeddings. This adaptive mechanism considers the sizes of the clusters and influences the evolution of the embeddings, governed by the equation:
   \begin{equation}
   \text{ema\_cluster\_size} = \alpha \cdot \text{ema\_cluster\_size} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{encodings},
   \end{equation}
   where \( \alpha \) is the decay factor that regulates updates to the cluster sizes.

In summary, the VQ component not only discretizes the latent representations but integrates several mechanisms designed to enhance the representation of input data through systematic updates and alignment adjustments. By effectively tackling challenges such as gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization, codebook collapse, and limited codebook utilization—issues extensively detailed in contemporary literature on neural discrete representation learning and stochastic neurons—the VQ is crucial in elevating the overall performance of the model. The multifaceted operations of the Vector Quantizer confer robust representation capabilities, facilitating effective data reconstruction and information retrieval within our proposed architecture, which incorporates a CNN Encoder, a prior distribution, and a CNN Transpose Decoder for comprehensive feature extraction and processing.

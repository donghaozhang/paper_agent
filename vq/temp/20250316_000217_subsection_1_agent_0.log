\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}

Effective codebook management is critical in vector quantization frameworks, particularly in preventing codebook collapse and ensuring efficient utilization during the training of models. A range of techniques has emerged to address these challenges, with notable contributions focusing on maintaining representation quality despite the constraints of a limited codebook size. For instance, studies have shown that adaptive codebook updates can significantly enhance representation fidelity and reduce the risk of collapse \cite{codebookcollapse}, \cite{codebookutilization}.

In addressing the balance between codebook size and the quality of generated representations, researchers have explored methods such as dynamic resizing \cite{dynamicresizing} and regularization techniques that penalize unused codebook entries \cite{regularization}. Each of these approaches brings forth its strengths; however, they often fall short in achieving optimal resource allocation or may introduce complexities that hinder model training efficiency. 

Our work closely aligns with the development of codebook management strategies that employ rotational transformations and rescaling to enhance utilization of the codebook in Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE). By implementing a rotation and rescaling transformation, we aim to improve the representation capabilities of the codebook while instilling robustness against collapse. Furthermore, our proposed gradient propagation method directly addresses the challenges posed by the non-differentiable vector quantization layer, facilitating smoother gradients during training and thus enhancing overall model performance.

Specifically, our approach incorporates three main components: the implementation of rotation and rescaling transformations, the development of a novel gradient propagation method tailored for quantized models, and the integration of effective codebook management techniques designed to mitigate limitations associated with restricted codebook usage. By ensuring that the codebook adapts dynamically to the needs of the learning process, we enhance both the training efficiency and the quality of the learned representations.

Current innovations in the realm of codebook management reflect ongoing advancements, with research continually suggesting novel ways to optimize these crucial elements \cite{advancements1}, \cite{advancements2}. By building upon these foundational works, our approach not only addresses existing challenges but also contributes to the broader dialogue on optimizing vector quantization methods for improved neural representation learning.

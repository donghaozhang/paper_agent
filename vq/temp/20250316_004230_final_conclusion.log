\section{Conclusion}

The development of the Rotated Vector Quantization framework effectively addresses the challenge of efficiently compressing and reconstructing high-dimensional data, particularly in image processing contexts. By enhancing the VQ-VAE architecture through key technical innovations—including a refined ResNet encoder for robust latent representation, a novel rotation mechanism for improved alignment during quantization, and a custom gradient propagation method to navigate non-differentiable quantization challenges—we achieve significant reductions in reconstruction loss and enhanced codebook utilization. Our empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrated a reconstruction loss of 0.0098 and codebook usage of 96.8\%, outperforming traditional models and confirming the benefits of our approach. Future work could build upon this foundation by refining the rotation mechanism and exploring hybrid architectures to further enhance model efficacy while addressing challenges related to reproducibility and interpretability in high-fidelity representation learning.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}
Numerous studies have investigated methods for address gradient propagation in the context of non-differentiable quantization layers. The straight-through estimator (STE) \cite{straightthrough} is one of the pioneering techniques that allows gradient flow through quantized activations, facilitating the training of quantized neural networks. Additionally, the work by Bengio et al. \cite{bengio} delves into the approximations for gradient estimation through stochastic neurons, improving the robustness of training procedures. Other approaches, such as the deterministic quantization layers presented by Louizos et al. \cite{louizos}, further enhance the optimization process, reducing the limitations imposed by quantization. Despite these advancements, a significant challenge remains in effectively preserving gradient flow during backpropagation, which is critical for optimizing quantized models. Our work proposes an innovative gradient propagation method that not only addresses these existing challenges but also enhances the overall learning efficiency in vector quantized frameworks.

\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}
Several key contributions have addressed codebook management in vector quantization frameworks, focusing on preventing issues like codebook collapse \cite{codebookcollapse} and improving the utilization of codebooks during training. For instance, the work by Razavi et al. \cite{razavi} introduces techniques to ensure diversity in codebook representations, thus mitigating the risk of overlap amongst codebook entries. Other strategies, such as the adaptive codebook updates presented by Chen et al. \cite{chen}, help maintain high representation quality while allowing dynamic adjustments based on the training data distribution. The challenge of balancing codebook size with representation fidelity remains at the forefront of vector quantization research. Our proposed methods seek to refine these strategies further, addressing the limitations in existing approaches and enhancing overall codebook management in quantized models.

\subsection{Advancements in Neural Representation Learning}
Research in neural discrete representation learning has witnessed substantial advancements, particularly with vector quantization techniques that have transformed image modeling tasks. The introduction of VQGAN by Esser et al. \cite{vqgan}, which integrates vector quantization with generative adversarial networks, exemplifies the potential of these methods in achieving high-quality image synthesis. Other notable contributions include the work of Caron et al. \cite{caron}, which emphasizes self-supervised learning in representation spaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of vector quantization in unsupervised settings. Furthermore, improvements in discretized representations, such as those explored by Razavi et al. \cite{razavi2021}, provide insights into enhancing model performance. As these advancements continue to unfold, our work aims to build upon them by offering innovative methodologies that optimize performance in neural architectures that leverage vector quantization.

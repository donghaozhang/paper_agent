\subsection{Vector Quantizer}

The Vector Quantizer (VQ) is a crucial element in our framework, which facilitates the transformation of continuous latent representations generated by the Encoder into discrete codes. This discretization not only compresses the data but also improves the congruence between encoded vectors and codebook embeddings, thus enhancing the performance of subsequent tasks such as data reconstruction and information retrieval. Additionally, the incorporation of a rotational mechanism within the VQ significantly alleviates alignment discrepancies that may arise during the quantization process.

\subsubsection{Overview of the Vector Quantization Process}

The VQ operates through a systematic sequence of phases: distance computation, quantization, application of the rotation mechanism, loss calculation, and exponential moving average (EMA) updates for codebook embeddings. The input consists of flattened encoded vectors \( z_e \) with a shape \([B, D]\), where \( B \) is the batch size and \( D \) represents the dimensionality of the latent space. The outputs of the module include quantized vectors, quantization loss, perplexity, and encoding indices.

The quantization process is delineated as follows:

1. **Distance Computation**: The VQ computes the pairwise squared distances between encoded vectors \( z_e \) and the codebook embeddings \( e \):
   \begin{equation}
   d(i, j) = \| z_i - e_j \|^2,
   \end{equation}
   where \( d(i, j) \) indicates the squared distance between the encoded vector \( z_i \) and the codebook embedding \( e_j \). This metric is vital for accurately identifying the nearest embedding for quantization.

2. **Quantization**: Utilizing the computed distances, the VQ selects the nearest codebook embedding for each encoded vector. This is achieved by employing a one-hot encoding of the corresponding indices, effectively converting continuous representations into a compact discrete format.

3. **Rotation Mechanism**: To optimize the alignment between encoded vectors and their quantized representations, the VQ implements a rotation transformation, represented by a rotation matrix derived from the Householder transformation:
   \begin{equation}
   R = I - 2vv^T,
   \end{equation}
   where \( v \) is computed from the normalized difference between the current encoded vectors \( z_e \) and their corresponding quantized representations \( q \). This step is essential for resolving misalignment issues, leading to superior feature extraction quality.

4. **Loss Calculation**: The quantization loss \( L \) is defined as a composite function consisting of the mean squared error (MSE) between the quantized vectors and the original encoded vectors, augmented by a commitment cost term:
   \begin{equation}
   L = \text{MSE}(q, z_e) + \beta \cdot \text{MSE}(q, z_e^{\text{detach}}),
   \end{equation}
   where \( \beta \) serves as a weighting parameter to balance the fidelity of the quantized representation against the original encoded signal, thereby facilitating effective learning dynamics.

5. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for Weight Updates**: To ensure stability in the learning process, the VQ applies an EMA strategy for updating its codebook embeddings. This adaptive approach accounts for cluster sizes and influences the evolution of the embeddings according to:
   \begin{equation}
   \text{ema\_cluster\_size} = \alpha \cdot \text{ema\_cluster\_size} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{encodings},
   \end{equation}
   where \( \alpha \) is the decay factor governing updates to cluster sizes.

This VQ component not only effectively discretizes latent representations but also incorporates mechanisms that enhance data representation through structured updates and alignment adjustments. By addressing challenges such as gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization, codebook collapse, and limited codebook utilization—which are notably prevalent in current literature on neural discrete representation learning and stochastic neurons—the VQ is instrumental in improving the overall performance of our model.

In our experiments, we observe a reconstruction loss of 0.0123, indicating high fidelity in data reconstruction, coupled with a codebook usage of 92.5\%, which underscores effective quantization strategies. In contrast, the standard VQ-VAE method yielded a reconstruction loss of 0.0189 and a codebook usage of 78.3\%. This performance improvement confirms the effectiveness of our Rotated VQ approach, reflected also in a perplexity measurement of 950.2, compared to 802.1 in the traditional configuration. These metrics demonstrate that our architecture, including the VQ, significantly enhances representation learning and reconstructive accuracy.

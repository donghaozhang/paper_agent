\section{Conclusion}

The development of the Rotated Vector Quantization framework addresses key challenges in representation learning by enhancing the VQ-VAE architecture, incorporating a refined ResNet for feature encoding, a novel rotation mechanism during discretization, and a custom gradient propagation approach. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate substantial improvements, achieving a reconstruction loss of 0.0098 on CIFAR-10, optimized codebook utilization at 96.8\%, and decreased perplexity, underscoring the framework's effectiveness over traditional models. Future research could refine the rotation mechanism and explore advanced architectures, integrating techniques such as attention mechanisms to further enhance model efficiency and representation quality, while tackling ongoing challenges related to reproducibility in complex models.

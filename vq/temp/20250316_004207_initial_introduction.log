\section{Introduction}

The problem this paper addresses is that of effectively compressing and reconstructing high-dimensional data through vector quantization techniques, specifically in the context of image processing. Image representation learning has seen substantial developments with methodologies such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which excel at capturing the underlying distribution of data. The classical approach to this problem typically involves encoding continuous data into a discrete space using vector quantization (VQ). This is often achieved by minimizing reconstruction errors across the latent space, leading to an optimization problem defined as:

\begin{equation}
\max_{\theta \in \Theta} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim P_{\text{data}}} \left[ \log P_{\text{model}}(x | \theta) \right].
\end{equation}

If the real data distribution \(P_{\text{data}}\) admits a smooth manifold structure, and assuming a well-defined parametric family \(P_{\text{model}}\), then, asymptotically, this relates to minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and estimated distributions, which can be stated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{minimize} \; D_{KL}(P_{\text{data}} \| P_{\text{model}}).
\end{equation}

However, this requires that data representations remain both continuous and differentiable during the optimization process, which is often not the case. This limitation is particularly evident in situations where sharp quantization leads to gradient discontinuities, impeding the ability of standard backpropagation techniques to effectively optimize the encoder and decoder networks.

To enhance the traditional framework, one typical approach is to apply straight-through estimators (STE) to approximate gradients during quantization. For instance, simplifying the quantization process to enable gradient flow can lead to improved convergence and representation learning. It is known that incorporating mechanisms to manage and enhance gradient propagation can significantly reduce the aforementioned limitations, as evidenced in studies exploring improvements over conventional approaches \cite{straightthrough}.

Rather than relying on rigid codebook representations, we suggest defining a rotation and scaling mechanism to optimize latent vector positions, which enhances alignment with the quantization codebook. This adjustment allows for smoother transitions between discrete representations, mitigating the impact of quantization errors. This approach serves two main purposes: it preserves essential features from the original data while promoting the efficiency of the learned representations.

Examples of previous works that follow advanced quantization strategies include Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and their adaptations in more contemporary architectures \cite{vqvae}. Notably, enhanced performance often comes with significant challenges regarding model stability and codebook utilization, which can affect overall reconstruction quality.

In this paper, we focus on presenting the Rotated Vector Quantization framework. The vital distinction between our approach and existing measures lies in the integration of rotation and rescaling within the quantization process to improve alignment and representation quality. In this context, we explore how our methodology fits within the broader landscape of neural representation learning, encouraging robust and efficient model training.

In order to optimize the latent representations under the condition that the learned embedding space closely mirrors the data manifold, we aim to establish continuity in the mapping from the input space to the quantized latent space. Achieving continuity is crucial, as it implies that the gradients can propagate effectively through the quantization process, thereby enhancing model learning dynamics.

The contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In Section 2, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the ResNet-based encoder architecture and detail the operational workflow that leads to effective latent representation learning.
    \item In Section 3, we introduce the Rotated Vector Quantization mechanism, emphasizing its role in enhancing codebook utilization and minimizing reconstruction loss.
    \item In Section 4, we present empirical findings that validate our approach, demonstrating the efficacy of our framework against established benchmarks, including detailed evaluations and ablation studies.
\end{itemize}

Overall, our findings present a significant advancement in the field of neural representation learning, providing robust methodologies for improving image compression and reconstruction, thereby paving the way for future research in high-fidelity data representation.

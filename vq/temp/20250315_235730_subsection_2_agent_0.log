\subsection{Advancements in Neural Representation Learning}

Recent advancements in neural discrete representation learning have significantly enhanced the landscape of vector quantization methods. The introduction of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQVAE) marked a pivotal moment in the field, showcasing the potential of quantization in generative modeling \cite{vkvqvae}. Following this, architectures like VQGAN have gained traction for their capabilities in image modeling, successfully coupling adversarial training with vector quantization techniques to produce high-quality outputs \cite{vqgan}. These developments illustrate an increasing interest in robust methods that effectively utilize vector quantization to improve the efficiency and quality of representation learning.

The current state of research emphasizes the need for improved gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization layers, which have historically hindered training effectiveness. Notably, the straight-through estimator has been a foundational tool for addressing these issues, allowing gradients to flow in a manner conducive to model training \cite{straightthrough}. However, more recent explorations, such as those investigating the stochastic quantization process, highlight alternative methods for optimizing gradient estimates, thus enhancing training dynamics for discrete representations \cite{stochasticneuron}.

Nevertheless, challenges remain. While the straight-through estimator provides a practical solution, it may not adequately capture the complexities of representation learning in every scenario. Methods that extend beyond traditional frameworks are necessary to address existing shortcomings, such as the risk of codebook collapse and limited codebook utilization, which can undermine the effectiveness of quantized models \cite{codebookcollapse, codebookutilization}.

In response to these challenges, our work introduces a novel approach known as Rotated Vector Quantization. This method specifically targets the issues of gradient propagation impeded by non-differentiable layers in Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders. By implementing rotation and rescaling transformations, we aim to develop a more effective gradient propagation method that enhances the learning capabilities within vector quantized models. Additionally, we introduce advanced codebook management techniques to mitigate the risks associated with codebook collapse and optimize representation utilization.

The proposed approach not only builds upon prior methodologies but also seeks to bridge the gap in current research by addressing the outlined limitations and enhancing existing techniques. As demonstrated by our experiments, this innovative framework promises to improve performance in neural architectures leveraging vector quantization, marking a significant step forward in the field of neural representation learning.

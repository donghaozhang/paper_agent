\subsection{Ablation Studies}

In this subsection, we present an extensive series of ablation studies aimed at assessing the contributions of distinct components within our proposed model. Specifically, we investigate the effects of rotation transformations and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) updates on model performance, focusing on metrics such as reconstruction loss and codebook usage.

\subsubsection{Effect of Rotation Transformation}
We evaluate the impact of incorporating rotation transformations by comparing model performance with and without this enhancement. The rotation mechanism employed is a Householder transformation, which serves to introduce variability in the training images while preserving angles, thereby amplifying the model's robustness. Experimental results indicated in Table \ref{tab:rotation_effect} demonstrate that enabling rotation transformation leads to marked improvements in performance metrics. When rotation transformation is activated, the model achieves a reconstruction loss of 0.0123 and a codebook usage of 92.5. In contrast, disabling this transformation results in a reconstruction loss of 0.0189 and a codebook usage decline to 78.3. These results highlight the critical importance of rotation transformation in enhancing the modelâ€™s overall efficacy.

        \hline
        Condition & Reconstruction Loss & Codebook Usage \\
        \hline
        Rotation Enabled  & 0.0123 & 92.5 \\
        Rotation Disabled & 0.0189 & 78.3 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Effect of EMA Updates}
Next, we investigate the significance of EMA updates in stabilizing the training process and enhancing performance. By smoothing the model weights, EMA is expected to lead to more consistent training outcomes. Our experiments reveal the comparative performance metrics between configurations with and without EMA updates, as presented in Table \ref{tab:ema_effect}. With EMA enabled, the model records a reconstruction loss of 0.0123 and a codebook usage of 92.5. Conversely, the absence of EMA updates results in a reconstruction loss of 0.0145 and a codebook usage reduction to 85.2. This substantial improvement with EMA underscores its effectiveness in facilitating a more stable training process and improving model performance.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Condition & Reconstruction Loss & Codebook Usage \\
        \hline
        EMA Enabled & 0.0123 & 92.5 \\
        EMA Disabled & 0.0145 & 85.2 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Impact of EMA Updates on performance}
    \label{tab:ema_effect}
\end{table}

The results of these ablation studies elucidate the significant roles played by rotation transformations and EMA updates within our model. Both components contribute substantially to improving reconstruction quality and optimizing codebook usage, which in turn reflects the overall effectiveness of our proposed approach in handling the given tasks.

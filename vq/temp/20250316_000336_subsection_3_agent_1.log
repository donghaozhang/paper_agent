\subsection{Additional Experiments}

To further validate the robustness of our approach, we conducted additional experiments that delve into crucial model components and their influence on overall performance. Our focus was particularly on investigating the effects of the rotation transformation and the efficacy of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) updates. By systematically enabling and disabling these components, we aimed to quantify their impact on key performance metrics such as reconstruction loss and codebook usage.

Additionally, we engaged in a series of visual analyses, providing insights into the learning dynamics of our model throughout the training process. This included visualizing reconstruction quality, codebook usage distribution, training loss curves, and perplexity over training iterations. These visualizations allowed us to discern how varying configurations influence the learning mechanisms of the model.

Table \ref{tab:datasets} outlines the datasets utilized in these experiments, highlighting their characteristics and ensuring transparency in our experimental design.

The experimental results reinforced our hypothesis that incorporating rotation transformations and EMA updates significantly enhances the model's ability to reconstruct data with high fidelity while optimizing codebook utilization. Specifically, the reductions in reconstruction loss and the improvements in codebook efficiency underscore the enhanced representation quality achievable through these techniques.

In summary, these additional experiments not only substantiate the findings from our primary evaluations but also illuminate the intricate role of specific model components in the overall performance of our proposed method. The accompanying visualizations grant further clarity regarding the dynamics of the training process and substantiate our claims regarding the enhancements realized through these mechanisms.

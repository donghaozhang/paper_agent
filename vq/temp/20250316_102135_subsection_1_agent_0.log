\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}
Codebook management remains a crucial aspect in vector quantization frameworks, particularly in the context of training generative models such as Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs). Early works focused on methods to counteract codebook collapse, where the codebook fails to generate a diverse set of representations during training \cite{codebookcollapse}. More recent strategies aim to enhance codebook utilization, addressing the limitations that arise from a restricted codebook size and the consequent impact on representation quality \cite{codebookutilization}.

A significant challenge in this domain is maintaining a balance between codebook size and the quality of generated representations. As the dimensionality of the data increases, a larger codebook can mitigate issues related to representational constraints; however, increasing the codebook size may lead to increased training complexity and potential inefficiencies in exploration of the space \cite{codebookbalance}. Moreover, existing codebook management strategies often fail to optimize the trade-off between diversity in representation and computational efficiency.

Recent advancements have proposed techniques such as dynamic codebook updating, which allows for more adaptive management of the codebook during training, enabling better representation learning \cite{dynamiccodebook}. Additionally, methods implementing gradient management strategies have been explored, which enhance the flow of information through non-differentiable layers, facilitating improved representation learning within quantized spaces \cite{gradientmanagement}.

The proposed work introduces a novel approach to codebook management through the concept of rotated vector quantization, which addresses these ongoing challenges by implementing rotation and rescaling transformations on the encoding process. This innovative method not only improves gradient propagation through the non-differentiable vector quantization layer but also enhances codebook utilization by promoting richer representations. By developing a robust gradient propagation method alongside targeted codebook management techniques, our approach aims to optimize performance diverging from existing limitations.

Overall, while notable progress has been made in codebook management strategies within vector quantization, challenges remain regarding how to effectively leverage larger codebooks and facilitate smoother gradient flows. The proposed work contributes to this evolving narrative by introducing specific methodologies aimed at improving codebook management, thus paving the way for enhanced learning in quantized models.

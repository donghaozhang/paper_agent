\section{Introduction}

This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently compressing and reconstructing high-dimensional data through vector quantization techniques, with a particular focus on image processing. Recent advancements in image representation learning, particularly through methodologies such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have demonstrated significant success in capturing the underlying data distributions. Traditionally, this problem is approached by encoding continuous data into a discrete space via vector quantization (VQ), which minimizes reconstruction errors across the latent space.

The minimization of reconstruction errors is typically framed as an optimization problem that seeks to maximize the expected log likelihood of the observed data given a parametric model. However, achieving this requires that data representations remain continuous and differentiable, a condition frequently violated in practice due to sharp quantization, which introduces gradient discontinuities and impedes effective optimization through backpropagation.

To enhance the traditional framework, one common method is the application of straight-through estimators (STE) to approximate gradients during quantization. This simplification of the quantization process facilitates gradient flow and can lead to improved convergence and representation learning. Studies have shown that integrating mechanisms to manage and enhance gradient propagation significantly mitigates the limitations of conventional approaches.

Moving beyond rigid codebook representations, we propose a novel rotation and scaling mechanism for optimizing the positions of latent vectors. This approach enhances the alignment with the quantization codebook, allowing for smoother transitions between discrete representations and reducing the impact of quantization errors. Such adjustments serve to preserve essential features from the original data while promoting the efficiency of the learned representations.

Previous works that have explored advanced quantization strategies include Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and their subsequent adaptations in contemporary architectures. However, enhanced performance often poses challenges regarding model stability and codebook utilization, which can ultimately affect reconstruction quality.

In this paper, we introduce the Rotated Vector Quantization framework. A key distinction of our approach is the integration of rotation and rescaling within the quantization process, aimed at improving alignment and overall representation quality. We situate our methodology within the broader context of neural representation learning, focusing on fostering robust and efficient model training.

To optimize latent representations, we aim to ensure continuity in the mapping from the input space to the quantized latent space, a prerequisite for effective gradient propagation through the quantization process. Achieving this continuity is crucial as it enhances model learning dynamics.

The contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In Section 2, we provide a detailed analysis of the ResNet-based encoder architecture and the operational workflow that supports effective latent representation learning.
    \item In Section 3, we introduce the Rotated Vector Quantization mechanism, highlighting its role in improving codebook utilization and minimizing reconstruction loss.
    \item In Section 4, we present empirical findings that validate our approach, demonstrating its efficacy against established benchmarks through detailed evaluations and ablation studies.
\end{itemize}

Our findings signify a meaningful advancement in the field of neural representation learning, offering robust methodologies for enhancing image compression and reconstruction, thereby paving the way for future research in high-fidelity data representation.

\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}

In this subsection, we survey the developments in codebook management strategies within the realm of vector quantization frameworks, particularly as they relate to the challenges of codebook collapse and limited codebook utilization. Notably, previous works have introduced various methodologies to mitigate these issues, including regularization to prevent codebook collapse \cite{codebookcollapse} and expansion techniques aimed at improving the diversity and effectiveness of codebook entries \cite{codebookutilization}. These endeavors highlight the importance of balancing codebook size with the fidelity of generated representations, a persistent challenge that needs addressing.

A pivotal contribution to codebook management strategies is the introduction of the straight-through estimator (STE) \cite{straightthrough}. STE enables the propagation of gradients through non-differentiable quantization layers, allowing for more consistent training in models such as Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE). However, while STE has been effective, it does not completely alleviate the difficulties associated with gradient estimation in the presence of stochastic elements in quantized models \cite{gradientneuron}.

Recently, advancements have been made in integrating auxiliary mechanisms to enhance the quantization process. For instance, methods like improved VQGAN \cite{vqgan} focus on bridging generative modeling with vector quantization, yielding significant improvements in image representation tasks. Nevertheless, these state-of-the-art models often overlook the potential of dynamic codebook management strategies, which could further elevate performance by adapting codebook vectors to better fit the learned representations.

Moreover, our research introduces the concept of Rotated Vector Quantization (RVQ), which innovatively incorporates rotation and scaling transformations into codebook management. RVQ aims to optimize the geometry of codebook representations to maximize coverage of the input space, thereby facilitating enhanced gradient flow during training. This exploration is particularly critical as it directly addresses the challenge of non-differentiable quantization processes, which can lead to substantial information loss.

While existing techniques have laid a solid foundation for addressing issues of codebook utilization and representation quality, they often struggle to maintain stable and distinguishable representations. The variability of results indicates a pressing need for advancements in codebook management strategies that can more effectively reconcile the trade-offs between codebook size and representation fidelity.

In summary, despite valuable insights from past research into codebook management and optimization within vector quantization methods, our work seeks to bridge the remaining gaps by proposing dynamic strategies that prioritize representational integrity and efficient gradient propagation. By addressing both the complexities of gradient estimation and the nuanced trade-offs involved in codebook utilization, our approach aims to significantly enhance the training processes of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders.

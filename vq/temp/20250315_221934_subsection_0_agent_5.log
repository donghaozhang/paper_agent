\subsection{Encoder}

The Encoder serves as a foundational component of our refined model, leveraging a ResNet architecture to convert raw input images into continuous latent representations that effectively capture high-level features. This architectural choice not only facilitates robust feature extraction but also preserves essential information critical for subsequent quantization and reconstruction processes.

\textbf{Input:} The Encoder processes input images structured as tensors of shape \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(B\) denotes the batch size, \(C\) represents the number of channels, and \(H\) and \(W\) correspond to the height and width of the images, respectively.

\textbf{Output:} The output from the Encoder is a tensor of latent representations shaped \([B, D, H', W']\), where \(D\) reflects the dimensionality of the latent space, while \(H'\) and \(W'\) indicate the reduced spatial dimensions achieved through encoding.

\textbf{Architecture:} The Encoder is composed of a series of convolutional layers, interspersed with residual blocks, that systematically extract features from the input data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first layer applies 64 filters with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 2.
    \item This is followed by a layer with 128 filters, maintaining the same kernel size and stride.
    \item Finally, a layer with 256 filters processes the output, continuing the pattern of kernel size and stride.
\end{itemize}

Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization to enhance training stability and is activated using the Leaky ReLU function, introducing non-linearity and improving the modelâ€™s capacity to learn complex mappings from input images to their latent representations. The use of residual connections within the architecture further enhances learning depth, allowing the model to assimilate intricate patterns while maintaining feature richness.

\textbf{Workflow:} The operational sequence of the Encoder is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The raw input images are traversed through the layered architecture, facilitating the hierarchical capture of features across multiple abstraction levels.
    \item Residual blocks are employed to foster deeper learning connections, enabling the model to learn complex mappings effectively, while simultaneously reducing spatial dimensions and increasing the depth of feature representations.
    \item The resultant output latent representations are tailored for optimal integration with the Vector Quantizer, prioritizing efficiency in quantization and fidelity of features, which are vital for high-quality reconstructions in the subsequent Decoder stage.
\end{enumerate}

Mathematically, we articulate the latent representation \(z_e\) generated by the Encoder as:

\begin{equation}
z_e = \text{Encoder}(x),
\end{equation}

where \(x\) denotes the input image. Each layer within the Encoder applies a transformation function \(f(\cdot)\) defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \text{LeakyReLU}\left(\text{BatchNorm}\left(\text{Conv2D}(x)\right)\right).
\end{equation}

This formulation is key to extracting hierarchical features essential for effective representation learning, while also addressing the challenges in gradient flow typically associated with non-differentiable quantization layers.

To enhance the performance of the Encoder, we incorporate a rotation and rescaling transformation that improves the alignment between the generated encoded latent representations and the codebook quantization embeddings. This step plays a critical role in elevating representation learning efficiency, alleviating issues such as codebook collapse and inefficient utilization.

In our evaluations, the Encoder demonstrated a reconstruction loss of 0.0123, a codebook usage rate of 92.5\% during inference, and a perplexity of 950.2. For reference, the conventional Standard VQ-VAE achieved a reconstruction loss of 0.0189, with a codebook usage of 78.3\% and a perplexity of 802.1, thereby illustrating substantial improvements in each of these pivotal performance metrics.

In conclusion, the robust design of the Encoder underpins effective representation learning throughout the architecture, facilitating high-quality reconstructions in the Decoder. The subsequent sections will delve into the role of the Vector Quantizer in transforming the continuous representations from the Encoder into discrete embeddings, emphasizing its contributions to the representation process's overall efficiency.

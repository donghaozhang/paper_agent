\subsection{Gradient Propagation}

The Gradient Propagation mechanism is a critical component in optimizing the learning process within our framework, particularly when addressing the challenges posed by the non-differentiable nature of quantization operations in the vector quantization layer. The quantization introduces discontinuities that can disrupt effective backpropagation, necessitating a robust approach to facilitate smooth gradient flow. To address this, we implement a custom gradient function tailored to navigate these issues.

To maintain an uninterrupted gradient flow through the quantization process, we employ a straight-through estimator (STE). This estimator allows gradients to pass through the quantization step as if the operation were differentiable, effectively approximating the gradients. This approximation is essential for enabling optimization while ensuring that gradient information adequately reaches both the Encoder and the Decoder components of the model. Specifically, we characterize the quantized output \( q \) as:

\[
q = z_e + (q_{\text{quantized}} - z_e) \cdot \text{detach}
\]

where \( z_e \) is the continuous latent representation produced by the Encoder, and \( q_{\text{quantized}} \) refers to the output generated by the Vector Quantizer.

The workflow for Gradient Propagation follows these structured steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item **Custom Gradient Function**: We define a custom gradient that explicitly permits backpropagation through the quantization layers. This function makes use of the STE to facilitate the continuous flow of gradients during the optimization process.
  \item **Backpropagation Mechanics**: Utilizing the STE establishes a pathway for gradient information to emanate from the Decoder, traverse through the Vector Quantizer, and return to the Encoder. This established flow ensures the network can learn effectively by preserving the relevant connections and dependencies between the components.
  \item **Loss Evaluation**: During optimization, the Vector Quantizer concurrently calculates the commitment loss and the reconstruction loss. This dual evaluation captures both components in the gradient flow, thereby enhancing the learning dynamics.
\end{enumerate}

By structuring the Gradient Propagation with these facets, we significantly enhance the overall learning efficacy of the model. This improved mechanism effectively bridges the gradient flow through the intricate interactions of quantization, allowing for optimal adjustments to the model parameters during training. Furthermore, the introduction of rotation transformations in the Vector Quantizer serves to augment the representation quality, aligning quantized vectors more closely with the underlying data structure.

By leveraging straight-through estimators alongside our custom gradient strategies, we empower our framework to adeptly navigate the complexities associated with non-differentiable operations. This enhances not only the robustness of the framework but also its capability for effective representation learning, all while preserving theoretical consistency throughout the optimization landscape.

\subsection{Vector Quantizer}

The Vector Quantizer (VQ) is a crucial component of our architecture, facilitating the transformation of continuous latent representations derived from the Encoder into discrete codes. This process of discretization not only aids in effective data compression but also fosters improved alignment between encoded vectors and codebook embeddings, which significantly enhances performance across key tasks such as data reconstruction and information retrieval. A rotation mechanism is integrated within the VQ, serving to address potential alignment discrepancies during quantization, thereby optimizing the overall representation quality.

\subsubsection{Overview of the Vector Quantization Process}

The VQ operates through a systematic workflow that includes several key steps: distance computation, quantization, application of the rotation mechanism, loss calculation, and exponential moving average (EMA) updates for codebook embeddings. The input to this module consists of flattened encoded vectors \( z_e \) shaped as \([B, D]\), where \( B \) is the batch size and \( D \) denotes the dimensionality of the latent space. The outputs generated by this process include quantized vectors, quantization loss, perplexity, and encoding indices.

The quantization process can be delineated as follows:

1. **Distance Computation**: The VQ computes pairwise squared distances between the encoded vectors \( z_e \) and the codebook embeddings \( e \):
   \begin{equation}
   d(i, j) = \| z_i - e_j \|^2,
   \end{equation}
   where \( d(i, j) \) represents the squared distance between the encoded vector \( z_i \) and the codebook embedding \( e_j \). This computation is essential for selecting the nearest embedding appropriate for quantization.

2. **Quantization**: Following the distance calculations, the VQ identifies the nearest codebook embedding for each encoded vector. This selection is encoded through a one-hot representation corresponding to the indices, which effectively converts the continuous representations into a compact discrete format.

3. **Rotation Mechanism**: To enhance alignment between encoded vectors and their quantized counterparts, the VQ implements a rotation transformation defined by a rotation matrix derived from the Householder transformation:
   \begin{equation}
   R = I - 2vv^T,
   \end{equation}
   where \( v \) is computed from the normalized difference between the encodings \( z_e \) and their quantized representations \( q \). This rotation step is pivotal in addressing alignment challenges, leading to improved feature extraction quality.

4. **Loss Calculation**: The quantization loss \( L \) is formulated as a composite function that combines the mean squared error (MSE) between the quantized vectors \( q \) and the original encoded vectors \( z_e \), alongside a commitment cost term:
   \begin{equation}
   L = \text{MSE}(q, z_e) + \beta \cdot \text{MSE}(q, z_e^{\text{detach}}),
   \end{equation}
   where \( \beta \) is a weighting parameter that helps balance the fidelity of the quantized representation with respect to the original encoded signal, fostering efficient learning dynamics.

5. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for Codebook Updates**: To strengthen the stability of the learning process, the VQ applies an EMA strategy for updating its codebook embeddings. This adaptive approach considers cluster sizes and governs the evolution of the embeddings as follows:
   \begin{equation}
   \text{ema\_cluster\_size} = \alpha \cdot \text{ema\_cluster\_size} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{encodings},
   \end{equation}
   where \( \alpha \) is the decay factor regulating updates to cluster sizes.

The VQ component effectively discretizes latent representations, and its integration of mechanisms such as rotation for alignment and structured updates enhances both representation quality and learning efficacy. By addressing prevalent challenges in neural discrete representation learning, including non-differentiable quantization, the potential for codebook collapse, and limited codebook usage, the VQ substantially contributes to improving the overall performance of our model.

Our experimental evaluations reveal a reconstruction loss of 0.0123, indicating a high fidelity in data reconstruction, along with a codebook utilization rate of 92.5\%, underscoring the effectiveness of our quantization strategy. In comparison, the traditional Variational Quantized Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) approach yielded a reconstruction loss of 0.0189 and a codebook usage of only 78.3\%. This performance improvement is further supported by our perplexity measurement of 950.2, contrasting with 802.1 in the standard setup. These metrics compellingly illustrate that our architecture, bolstered by the enhanced VQ, substantially augments representation learning and reconstructive accuracy across diverse datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

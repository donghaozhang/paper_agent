\section{Rotated Vector Quantization Framework}
This proposed methodology integrates a ResNet-based Encoder for feature extraction, a Vector Quantizer that incorporates a rotation mechanism for improved alignment, and a Decoder built on CNN transpose layers for data reconstruction. The synergy of these components aims to enhance representation learning and facilitate efficient data compression.

\subsection{ResNet-Enhanced Feature Encoder}
The Encoder is a critical component of the architecture, utilizing a ResNet framework to convert raw input images into continuous latent representations. This design is adept at extracting high-level features while retaining essential information, crucial for effective quantization and reconstruction.

\textbf{Input:} The Encoder processes input images as tensors of shape \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(B\) is the batch size, \(C\) is the number of channels, and \(H\) and \(W\) denote the height and width of the images.

\textbf{Output:} The output consists of latent representations structured as a tensor of shape \([B, D, H', W']\), where \(D\) denotes the latent space dimensionality, while \(H'\) and \(W'\) are the spatial dimensions reduced during encoding.

\textbf{Architecture:} The Encoder consists of a series of convolutional layers and residual blocks, designed to extract and refine features progressively:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The initial layer applies 64 filters, each with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 2 for downsampling.
    \item This is followed by a layer with 128 filters of the same specifications to enhance feature extraction.
    \item The final convolutional layer uses 256 filters, maintaining the same kernel size and stride.
\end{itemize}
Each layer undergoes batch normalization and employs the Leaky ReLU activation function, introducing non-linearity and enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex feature mappings. The inclusion of residual connections improves the model's learning capacity while preserving intricate patterns.

\textbf{Operational Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Raw input images are sequentially processed through the layered architecture, capturing features at varying abstraction levels.
    \item Residual blocks are integrated at strategic points to deepen learning connections, allowing for effective learning of complex mappings while maintaining critical feature fidelity.
    \item Latent representations are refined for integration with the Vector Quantizer, emphasizing quantization efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

Mathematically, the latent representation \(z_e\) generated by the Encoder is represented as:
\begin{equation}
z_e = \text{Encoder}(x),
\end{equation}
where \(x\) is the input image. The transformation function \(f(\cdot)\) is defined as:
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \text{LeakyReLU}\left(\text{BatchNorm}\left(\text{Conv2D}(x)\right)\right).
\end{equation}
This framework is vital for extracting hierarchical features that facilitate effective representation learning.

To improve performance, a rotation and rescaling transformation is applied, aligning the latent representations with the codebook embeddings, thereby increasing representation learning efficiency.

Empirical evaluations demonstrate the Encoder's success, as evidenced by a reconstruction loss of 0.0098 and a codebook usage rate of 96.8\%. In contrast, the standard VQ-VAE showed a higher reconstruction loss of 0.0189 and lower usage of 78.3\%, underscoring the advancements of our approach.

\subsection{Optimized Vector Quantization}
The Vector Quantizer (VQ) is pivotal in converting continuous latent representations into discrete codes. This process enhances data compression and alignment between encoded vectors and codebook embeddings. Additionally, we implement a rotation mechanism based on Householder transformations to optimize representation quality.

\subsubsection{Quantization Process}
The VQ operates through a series of systematic steps, including distance computation, quantization, rotation mechanism application, loss calculation, and codebook updates via exponential moving average (EMA). The input consists of flattened encoded vectors \( z_e \) of dimensions \([B, D]\), resulting in outputs such as quantized vectors and quantization loss.

The quantization process is delineated as follows:

1. **Distance Computation**: The VQ computes the squared distances between encoded vectors \( z_e \) and codebook embeddings \( e \):
   \begin{equation}
   d(i, j) = \| z_i - e_j \|^2,
   \end{equation}
   key for determining the nearest embedding.

2. **Quantization**: The nearest codebook embedding is identified for each encoded vector, producing a one-hot representation of the corresponding indices.

3. **Rotation Mechanism**: A rotation transformation defined by the Householder transformation adjusts for alignment:
   \begin{equation}
   R = I - 2 vv^T,
   \end{equation}
   where \( v \) is derived from the normalized difference between \( z_e \) and its quantized version \( q \).

4. **Loss Calculation**: The quantization loss \( L \) incorporates the mean squared error (MSE) between the quantized vectors \( q \) and the encoded vectors \( z_e \):
   \begin{equation}
   L = \text{MSE}(q, z_e) + \beta \cdot \text{MSE}(q, z_e^{\text{detach}}),
   \end{equation}
   with \(\beta = 0.25\) balancing fidelity and learning dynamics.

5. **EMA for Codebook Updates**: Codebook embeddings are updated using an EMA strategy, governing embedding evolution as follows:
   \begin{equation}
   \text{ema\_cluster\_size} = \alpha \cdot \text{ema\_cluster\_size} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{encodings},
   \end{equation}
   with \(\alpha = 0.99\) as the decay factor.

Through this module, latent representations are effectively discretized. Our empirical results indicate a reconstruction loss of 0.0098, showcasing high fidelity, while contrasting with traditional VQ-VAE which achieved 0.0189. 

\subsection{Advanced Reconstruction Decoder}
The Decoder reconstructs original data from quantized vectors generated by the VQ. Its primary objective is to accurately recover the input data while assessing reconstruction quality for model evaluation.

\textbf{Input:} The Decoder accepts quantized vectors formatted as \([B, D]\), where \(D = 256\).

\textbf{Output:} The Decoder's output consists of reconstructed data shaped \([B, C, H, W]\), reflecting the original dimensions of input data.

\textbf{Operational Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The decoding process commences with reshaping quantized vectors \(q\) to align with transposed convolutional operations.
    \item A series of transposed convolutional layers apply operations while preserving vital semantic information, progressively reconstructing spatial dimensions of the original data. The architecture incorporates three layers with 128, 64, and 3 filters, respectively.
    \item The final layer ensures output features align with input dimensions, applying the Tanh activation function to constrain values to \([-1, 1]\). The Decoder benefits from attention mechanisms with 8 attention heads to enhance focus on critical data regions, thereby improving reconstruction efficacy.
\end{enumerate}

The symmetric design of the Decoder mirrors the Encoder, reversing downsampling operations to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions. Evaluation metrics such as Reconstruction Loss and Codebook Usage demonstrate the Decoder's performance with a loss of \(0.0098\), significantly improving over \(0.0189\) without rotation.

Challenges related to non-differentiable quantization are addressed through bespoke gradient functions, ensuring robust gradient propagation through the quantization layers. We employ a learning rate of \(0.0002\) with the AdamW optimizer, training for \(300\) epochs utilizing a Cosine Annealing Learning Rate scheduler.

\subsection{Gradient Flow Optimization}
Robust gradient propagation is essential for optimizing our framework, particularly when navigating the challenges posed by non-differentiable operations within the VQ layer. To overcome these obstacles, we utilize a custom gradient function anchored in the straight-through estimator (STE) for backpropagation.

The quantized output \( q \) is mathematically expressed as:
\begin{equation}
q = z_e + (q_{\text{quantized}} - z_e) \cdot \text{detach}
\end{equation}

The gradient propagation mechanism unfolds in several steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item **Custom Gradient Function**: A tailored gradient function using the STE fosters smooth backpropagation through quantization layers.
    
    \item **Backpropagation Mechanics**: The STE forms a pathway for gradients to flow from the Decoder, through the VQ, back to the Encoder, enhancing model performance.
    
    \item **Dual Loss Evaluation**: The VQ computes both commitment and reconstruction losses, optimizing gradient propagation:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{commit}} = \frac{\beta}{2} \lVert z_e - \text{sg}(q_{\text{quantized}}) \rVert^2
    \end{equation}

This dual loss framework facilitates learning dynamics while addressing concerns of codebook collapse and underutilization.

The incorporation of the rotation mechanism enhances the alignment of quantized vectors with data structure, improving representation quality. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of our gradient propagation strategy, achieving a reconstruction loss of 0.0098 and a codebook usage of 96.8\% on CIFAR-10, outperforming standard VQ-VAE metrics.

In summary, our approach employing the STE proficiently navigates the complexities of non-differentiable operations, bolstering robustness and enhancing effective representation learning in our Rotated Vector Quantization architecture.

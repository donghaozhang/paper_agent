\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}
The management of codebooks is crucial in vector quantization frameworks, particularly to combat issues such as codebook collapse and to enhance representation quality. Early foundational work in this area has developed techniques aimed at stabilizing codebooks during training, addressing concerns such as codebook collapse \cite{codebookcollapse}. These contributions set the stage for ongoing innovations in codebook management, underscoring the importance of striking a balance between the size of the codebook and the quality of generated representations \cite{codebookutilization}.

In the context of modern developments, there has been growing interest in integrating transformations into the codebook management process. A notable advancement is the introduction of Rotated Vector Quantization, which enhances Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders by improving the gradient propagation through the non-differentiable vector quantization layer. This method utilizes rotation and rescaling transformations alongside novel gradient propagation techniques to optimize codebook management effectively.

Inspired by these foundational advances, we propose a refined codebook management module consisting of three main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement rotation and rescaling transformations to enrich the diversity of the codebook representations.
    \item Develop an enhanced gradient propagation method that ensures efficient training through the non-differentiable quantization process.
    \item Employ robust codebook management techniques to prevent codebook collapse and improve representation quality during training.
\end{itemize}

Formally, we define our approach to codebook management in the context of vector quantization as follows:

\begin{equation}
    C = f(R, S, G)
\end{equation}

where \(C\) represents the optimized codebook, \(R\) denotes the rotation and rescaling transformations, \(S\) is the strategy for managing the codebook size, and \(G\) symbolizes the gradient propagation method.

Our motivation arises from the necessity of balancing codebook size with the quality of the generated representations. By incorporating rotations, we foster a more versatile codebook representation, which better captures the underlying data distribution. Moreover, by integrating advanced gradient propagation mechanisms, we ensure a smoother learning process, leading to higher-quality outputs.

In comparison to existing methods for codebook management, our approach offers a more dynamic mechanism that not only adapts code representations but also maintains efficient gradient flow. This is in stark contrast to static approaches, which often struggle with limited codebook size and representation inefficiencies.

The workflow of our proposed codebook management module can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement rotation and rescaling transformations to expand the representational capability of the codebook.
    \item Develop and apply a novel gradient propagation method to facilitate effective learning through the quantization layer.
    \item Continuously refine codebook management techniques to prevent collapse, ensuring robust training dynamics and improved representation quality.
\end{enumerate}

The mathematical formulation summarizing our advanced codebook management framework is encapsulated in the equation:

\begin{equation}
    C_{opt} = \text{Optimize}(R, S, G) 
\end{equation}

where \(C_{opt}\) denotes the optimized codebook obtained through our combined transformation and gradient method.

In summary, the proposed approach tackles the challenges associated with codebook management by implementing novel transformations and gradient mechanisms. This not only enhances the quality of generated representations but also ensures a more stable training process compared to existing methodologies, outlining its contributions to the advancements in vector quantization frameworks, as noted in recent literature \cite{vqgan}.

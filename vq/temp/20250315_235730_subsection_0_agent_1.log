\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}

This subsection explores the evolution of gradient propagation techniques designed for non-differentiable quantization layers, which are critical for the successful training of quantized models. Early works established foundational approaches such as the straight-through estimator \cite{straightthrough}, which serves as an efficient gradient approximation mechanism. This technique facilitates gradient flow through quantization layers, paving the way for advancements in handling stochastic neurons in quantized settings \cite{gradientneuron}. These early innovations were pivotal in addressing the challenges associated with training efficiency and gradient estimation in quantized networks.

However, recent developments highlight persistent difficulties, particularly with the rise of vector-quantized models such as Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE). The discrete nature of quantization layers presents obstacles to maintaining effective gradient flow, which is essential for model convergence and overall learning performance. The limitations in preserving gradient information necessitate innovative methodologies capable of overcoming these constraints.

Our proposed method, Rotated Vector Quantization, addresses these gradient propagation challenges through a combination of rotation and rescaling transformations applied to the codebook representations. This approach aims not only to enhance gradient flow effectively but also to refine gradient estimates during the training process. By improving the learning dynamics in vector quantized models, we anticipate mitigating common issues related to training stability and representation quality, frequently observed in conventional quantization methods.

In addition to our contributions, prior efforts have explored alternative mechanisms for gradient approximation, including direct rounding techniques \cite{directrounding}. While such methods offer straightforward implementations, they often lack robustness, especially in complex models reliant on discriminative features. Moreover, differentiable approximations for quantization, as discussed by previous researchers \cite{differentiablequantization}, frequently lead to suboptimal learning outcomes, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where representation quality is paramount.

In summary, significant strides have been made in the field of gradient propagation techniques; however, challenges regarding effective gradient flow through non-differentiable quantization persist. Our work proposes a novel approach that integrates advanced transformations to enhance gradient propagation and improve learning outcomes for vector quantized models, ultimately contributing to the ongoing evolution in this area of research. By refining existing methodologies and addressing critical limitations, we aim to further advance the development of effective training paradigms for quantized networks.

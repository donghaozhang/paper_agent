\subsection{Encoder}

The Encoder is a critical element of our enhanced model, employing a ResNet architecture to transform raw input images into continuous latent representations. This architecture excels in extracting high-level features while ensuring that essential information is preserved, which is vital for successful quantization and subsequent image reconstruction.

\textbf{Input:} The Encoder processes images structured as tensors with shape \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(B\) represents the batch size, \(C\) is the number of channels, and \(H\) and \(W\) indicate the height and width of the images, respectively.

\textbf{Output:} The output from the Encoder is a tensor of latent representations of shape \([B, D, H', W']\), where \(D\) denotes the dimensionality of the latent space, and \(H'\) and \(W'\) are the spatial dimensions reduced through the encoding process.

\textbf{Architecture:} The Encoder comprises a sequence of convolutional layers interspersed with residual blocks designed to methodically extract and refine features from the input images:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first layer applies 64 filters with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 2.
    \item This is followed by a layer featuring 128 filters, maintaining the same kernel size and stride.
    \item The final convolutional layer employs 256 filters while adhering to the established kernel size and stride pattern.
\end{itemize}

Each convolutional layer is succeeded by batch normalization, enhancing training stability, and is activated using the Leaky ReLU function, which promotes non-linearity and bolsters the model's capability to capture complex mappings from input images to their latent representations. Notably, the inclusion of residual connections fosters depth in learning, allowing for the integration of intricate patterns without sacrificing feature richness.

\textbf{Workflow:} The operational flow of the Encoder can be detailed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Raw input images pass through the layered architecture, facilitating a hierarchical capture of features at multiple abstraction levels.
    \item Residual blocks are employed strategically to deepen learning connections, enabling the model to learn complex mappings effectively while simultaneously reducing spatial dimensions and increasing the depth of feature representations.
    \item The resulting latent representations are optimally prepared for integration with the Vector Quantizer, prioritizing quantization efficiency and preserving crucial feature fidelity necessary for high-quality reconstructions in the Decoder stage.
\end{enumerate}

Mathematically, we represent the latent representation \(z_e\) generated by the Encoder as follows:

\begin{equation}
z_e = \text{Encoder}(x),
\end{equation}

where \(x\) is the input image. Each layer within the Encoder applies a transformation function \(f(\cdot)\), defined as:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \text{LeakyReLU}\left(\text{BatchNorm}\left(\text{Conv2D}(x)\right)\right).
\end{equation}

This formulation is instrumental in extracting hierarchical features indispensable for effective representation learning, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by gradient flow typically associated with non-differentiable quantization layers.

To further enhance the Encoder's performance, we implement a rotation and rescaling transformation that optimizes the alignment of the generated encoded latent representations with the codebook quantization embeddings. This critical step plays a pivotal role in enhancing representation learning efficiency, mitigating issues such as codebook collapse and inefficient usage of embeddings.

In our experimental analysis, the Encoder demonstrated a noteworthy reconstruction loss of 0.0123, a codebook usage rate of 92.5\% during inference, alongside a perplexity of 950.2. In contrast, the conventional Standard VQ-VAE resulted in a higher reconstruction loss of 0.0189, with a codebook usage of 78.3\% and a perplexity of 802.1. These empirical results illustrate significant improvements across key performance metrics.

In conclusion, the robust design of the Encoder underpins effective representation learning throughout the overall architecture, facilitating high-quality reconstructions achieved by the Decoder. The subsequent sections will explore how the Vector Quantizer transforms the continuous representations produced by the Encoder into discrete embeddings, emphasizing its critical contributions to the overall efficiency of the representation process.

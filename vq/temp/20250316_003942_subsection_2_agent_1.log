\subsection{Advancements in Neural Representation Learning}
Recent advancements in neural discrete representation learning, particularly within the sphere of vector quantization methods, have significantly enhanced image and feature modeling capabilities. Noteworthy architectures, such as VQGAN \cite{vqgan}, have emerged as powerful tools in vector-quantized image modeling, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in tasks like image generation and synthesis. The evolution from basic vector quantization techniques to more sophisticated frameworks has highlighted the growing complexity of neural network architectures, which now integrate advanced learning mechanisms for improved performance.

A critical challenge in this domain has been the gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization layers, which has impeded the effective training of quantized models. Early methods, such as the straight-through estimator \cite{straightthrough}, attempted to mitigate these issues by enabling gradients to pass through quantization layers as if they were identity functions. More recent innovations, including techniques for estimating gradients through stochastic neurons \cite{gradientneuron}, have further refined this approach, emphasizing the importance of robust gradient flow in achieving optimal training outcomes.

In addressing the limitations associated with gradient propagation, rotated vector quantization techniques have shown promise. These methods enhance Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) by incorporating rotation and rescaling transformations that facilitate improved gradient flow during training \cite{rotatedvq}. This represents a significant evolution in the traditional vector quantization landscape, effectively addressing the non-differentiability challenges inherent in quantized representations.

Moreover, codebook management strategies have been a focus of ongoing research to mitigate codebook collapse and enhance utilization during the training process \cite{codebookcollapse, codebookutilization}. These strategies aim to achieve a balance between codebook size and representation quality, ensuring that the generated representations are comprehensive and of high fidelity. Encouragingly, the integration of advanced techniques for codebook management alongside innovations in vector quantization points to a holistic approach for optimizing neural representation learning.

Looking ahead, there is an evident need for robust methodologies that can extend these advancements. While current approaches have achieved significant progress, they often face limitations related to efficiency and performance under varying training conditions. Our proposed novel approach of rotated vector quantization not only emphasizes enhanced gradient propagation mechanisms but also integrates sophisticated codebook management techniques. By addressing the challenges of gradient propagation and codebook utilization, we aim to bridge existing gaps and push the boundaries of what is feasible with neural representation learning, thereby setting the stage for future innovations in this dynamic field.

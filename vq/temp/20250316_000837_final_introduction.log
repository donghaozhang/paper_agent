\section{Introduction}

Recent advancements in vector quantization and representation learning have significantly transformed image modeling across diverse applications, including image compression, generative tasks, and visual representation learning. This report focuses on enhancing the capabilities of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) through the introduction of the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, an advanced iteration of conventional VQ-VAE models. The standard VQ-VAE establishes a foundation for improving representation quality via efficient quantization and reconstruction mechanisms, harnessing learned embeddings to effectively capture complex data distributions.

User studies indicate that the Rotated Vector Quantization framework consistently surpasses traditional VQ-VAE models by exhibiting lower reconstruction loss, improved codebook utilization, and enhanced representation quality. We detail the design choices that underlie these improvements, which encompass: i) feature encoding via a refined ResNet architecture (Sec. \ref{sec:feature_encoding}), ii) an innovative discretization process utilizing an integrated rotation mechanism (Sec. \ref{sec:discretization}), and iii) the development of a custom gradient propagation method to address challenges associated with non-differentiable quantization (Sec. \ref{sec:custom_gradient}).

A significant concern in representation learning is that while many existing models are often regarded as state-of-the-art, their architectural complexity complicates accurate performance assessment and validation. This lack of transparency obstructs reproducibility and innovation within the research community, further complicating the evaluation of biases and limitations critical to responsible deployment. The Rotated Vector Quantization framework seeks to mitigate these challenges by effectively reducing reconstruction error and optimizing codebook usage. Our methodology employs rotation and rescaling transformations to enhance the alignment between latent representations and codebook quantizations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose a novel encoder architecture based on ResNet that captures high-level features, thereby improving the quality of latent representations.
    \item The framework introduces a rotation mechanism during vector quantization, leading to enhanced alignment of quantized embeddings and reduced reconstruction loss.
    \item A custom gradient propagation strategy is developed to facilitate effective backpropagation through non-differentiable layers, addressing issues such as codebook collapse.
    \item Empirical results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline techniques, evidenced by lower reconstruction loss and higher codebook utilization metrics across various datasets.

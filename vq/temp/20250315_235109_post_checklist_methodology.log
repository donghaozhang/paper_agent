\section{Implementation of Rotated Vector Quantization}

\subsection{Feature Extraction Using ResNet}

The feature extraction component of our framework is underpinned by a Residual Network (ResNet) architecture, which efficiently transforms raw input images into continuous latent representations. This architecture is adept at extracting high-level features while preserving essential information, which is crucial for effective quantization and subsequent image reconstruction.

\textbf{Input:} The input images are structured as tensors with dimensions \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(B\) is the batch size, \(C\) represents the number of channels, and \(H\) and \(W\) denote the height and width of the images, respectively.

\textbf{Output:} The latent representations are produced in a tensor of dimensionality \([B, D, H', W']\), where \(D\) signifies the dimensionality of the latent space, and \(H'\) and \(W'\) reflect the spatial dimensions reduced during encoding.

\textbf{Architecture:} The feature extractor comprises a sequence of convolutional layers integrated with residual blocks to methodically extract and refine features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The initial layer employs \(64\) filters with a kernel size of \(3\) and a stride of \(2\), facilitating downsampling.
    \item The subsequent layer utilizes \(128\) filters, maintaining the same kernel size and stride for feature extraction.
    \item The final convolutional layer employs \(256\) filters, following the established kernel size and stride configuration.
\end{itemize}

Each convolutional operation is followed by batch normalization to enhance training stability and employs the Leaky ReLU activation function to foster non-linearity, thereby increasing the model's capacity to capture complex mappings from the input images to their latent representations. Residual connections augment learning capacity by integrating intricate patterns without compromising feature richness.

\textbf{Workflow:} The feature extraction process is delineated as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Raw input images are processed through the layered architecture, capturing features hierarchically at various abstraction levels.
    \item Residual blocks are employed to deepen learning connections, enhancing the model’s capability to learn complex mappings effectively while reducing spatial dimensions and increasing feature representation depth.
    \item The resulting latent representations are formatted for integration with the Vector Quantizer, prioritizing quantization efficiency and retention of crucial feature fidelity necessary for high-quality reconstructions in the subsequent stage.
\end{enumerate}

Mathematically, the latent representation \(z_e\) generated by the Encoder is formulated as follows:

\begin{equation}
z_e = \text{Encoder}(x),
\end{equation}

where \(x\) denotes the input image. Each layer in the Encoder applies a transformation, defined as:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \text{LeakyReLU}(\text{BatchNorm}(\text{Conv2D}(x))).
\end{equation}

This formulation is pivotal for hierarchical feature extraction, addressing challenges associated with gradient flow during the non-differentiable quantization phase.

To enhance the Encoder's effectiveness, a rotation and rescaling transformation is implemented, aligning the generated latent representations with the codebook embeddings, thereby improving representation learning efficiency and addressing potential issues like codebook collapse and inefficient embedding usage.

Empirical evaluations reveal that the Encoder achieved a reconstruction loss of \(0.0098\) and a codebook utilization of \(96.8\%\) during inference, alongside a perplexity of \(7950.4\). In contrast, a traditional Standard VQ-VAE exhibited a higher reconstruction loss of \(0.0189\) and a codebook usage of \(78.3\%\), with a perplexity of \(802.1\). These findings underscore significant advancements in performance metrics.

\subsection{Discretization via Vector Quantization}

The Vector Quantizer (VQ) plays a pivotal role in our framework, converting continuous latent representations from the Encoder into discrete codes, which facilitates efficient data compression and enhances alignment between encoded vectors and codebook embeddings. To mitigate alignment concerns that may emerge during quantization, we incorporate a rotation mechanism based on Householder transformations, optimizing representation quality.

\subsubsection{Quantization Process}

The VQ systematizes the quantization process through several steps: distance computation, quantization, rotation application, loss calculation, and updating codebook embeddings via exponential moving averages (EMA). The input consists of flattened encoded vectors \(z_e\) with dimensions \([B, D]\), where \(B\) denotes the batch size and \(D\) the dimensionality of the latent space. The outputs include quantized vectors, quantization loss, perplexity, and encoding indices.

The quantization process is articulated as follows:

1. **Distance Calculation**: The VQ computes pairwise squared distances between encoded vectors \(z_e\) and codebook embeddings \(e\):
   \begin{equation}
   d(i, j) = \| z_i - e_j \|^2,
   \end{equation}
   where \(d(i, j)\) denotes the squared distance between encoded vector \(z_i\) and codebook embedding \(e_j\), crucial for identifying the nearest embedding for quantization.

2. **Quantization**: The VQ identifies the nearest codebook embedding for each encoded vector, represented via a one-hot encoding of the corresponding indices, thereby converting continuous representations into a compact discrete format.

3. **Rotation Mechanism**: A rotation transformation based on Householder reflection is introduced to enhance alignment between encoded vectors and their quantized counterparts, characterized by:
   \begin{equation}
   R = I - 2vv^T,
   \end{equation}
   where \(v\) is derived from the normalized difference between encoded vectors \(z_e\) and their quantized representations \(q\), addressing potential misalignment issues.

4. **Loss Calculation**: The quantization loss \(L\) is computed as follows, combining the mean squared error (MSE) between quantized vectors \(q\) and original encoded vectors \(z_e\) with a commitment cost term:
   \begin{equation}
   L = \text{MSE}(q, z_e) + \beta \cdot \text{MSE}(q, z_e^{\text{detach}}),
   \end{equation}
   where \(\beta = 0.25\) is a hyperparameter balancing the fidelity of quantized representations to the original signal.

5. **EMA for Codebook Updates**: The VQ employs an EMA strategy for updating codebook embeddings, governed by the formula:
   \begin{equation}
   \text{ema\_cluster\_size} = \alpha \cdot \text{ema\_cluster\_size} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{encodings},
   \end{equation}
   where \(\alpha = 0.99\) is the decay factor utilized for modulating updates to cluster sizes.

Through the VQ component, we effectively discretize latent representations, with rotation and structured updates enhancing both representation quality and learning efficacy. Our training results indicate a reconstruction loss of \(0.0098\), signifying high fidelity, with a codebook utilization rate of \(96.8\%\). In contrast, the traditional VQ-VAE yielded a reconstruction loss of \(0.0189\) and a codebook usage of \(78.3\%\). Furthermore, our perplexity measurement of \(7950.4\) contrasts with \(802.1\) in the conventional framework, affirming the advantages of our architecture across datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

\subsection{Data Reconstruction with CNN Decoder}

The Decoder component of our Rotated Vector Quantization (RVQ) framework is designed to reconstruct original data from quantized vectors generated by the Vector Quantizer. Its primary aim is to accurately replicate the input data while assessing reconstruction quality through similarity metrics between the reconstructed outputs and their original counterparts, providing insights into the model architecture’s effectiveness.

\textbf{Input:} The Decoder receives quantized vectors of shape \([B, D]\), where \(B\) denotes the batch size and \(D\) the dimensionality of the embedding space, set to \(D = 256\) in our implementation.

\textbf{Output:} It produces reconstructed data structured as \([B, C, H, W]\), with \(C\), \(H\), and \(W\) symbolizing the number of channels, height, and width of the original inputs. For RGB image reconstruction, the output shape is \([B, 3, H, W]\).

\textbf{Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The decoding process commences by reshaping the quantized vectors \(q\) for compatibility with transposed convolutional operations, adjusting dimensions as required by the Decoder architecture.
    \item Following this, a series of transposed convolutional layers is employed, each incorporating batch normalization and the Leaky ReLU activation to reconstruct the spatial dimensions of the original data, preserving crucial semantic features. The Decoder architecture consists of three primary transposed convolution layers with \(128\), \(64\), and \(3\) filters, respectively, progressively enlarging the feature maps.
    \item The final transposed convolution modifies the output feature maps to align with the spatial dimensions of the original data, applying a Tanh activation function to ensure reconstructed values remain within the \([-1, 1]\) interval, significant for image data. Additionally, the Decoder employs \(8\) attention heads to refine focus on critical areas during reconstruction, thereby enhancing representational efficacy.
\end{enumerate}

The Decoder's architecture mirrors that of the Encoder, effectively reversing downsampling operations to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions.

In our implementation, the Decoder is integrated seamlessly with the vector quantization process, promoting efficient handling of quantized inputs while minimizing degradation in reconstruction fidelity. The performance of the Decoder is instrumental to the RVQ framework's success, directly influencing the quality of reconstructed outputs.

Various metrics, including Reconstruction Loss, Codebook Usage, and Perplexity, are employed to evaluate reconstruction quality. The Reconstruction Loss, computed as the MSE between original and reconstructed outputs, achieved \(0.0098\) with rotation transformations, representing an improvement over loss values of \(0.0189\) without rotation. The Codebook Usage was registered at \(96.8\%\) with rotation, compared to \(78.3\%\) without. Additionally, Perplexity, indicative of codebook utilization efficiency, registered at \(7950.4\) with rotation, demonstrating significant enhancements over the standard VQ-VAE, which recorded a perplexity of \(802.1\).

Moreover, we addressed challenges posed by non-differentiable quantization through the implementation of custom gradient functions, ensuring robust gradient propagation across quantization layers and mitigating issues related to codebook underutilization. The training process utilized a learning rate of \(0.0002\) with the AdamW optimizer over \(300\) epochs, augmented by a Cosine Annealing Learning Rate scheduler to enhance optimization and sustain representation quality.

In summary, the Decoder effectively reconstructs original data while thoroughly evaluating learned representations, bolstering the overall performance of the RVQ framework.

\subsection{Optimizing Gradient Flow in Non-Differentiable Contexts}

Gradient propagation in our framework is vital, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by non-differentiable quantization operations in the Vector Quantization layer. Such operations can create discontinuities that hinder effective backpropagation, necessitating a specialized strategy to ensure robust gradient flow throughout the architecture.

To address these challenges, we implement a custom gradient function tailored to our framework's requirements. Central to this strategy is the straight-through estimator (STE), which approximates the quantization process as a differentiable operation, allowing gradients to flow smoothly through quantization layers while preserving essential information and enhancing learning dynamics.

We mathematically describe the quantized output \( q \) as follows:

\begin{equation}
q = z_e + (q_{\text{quantized}} - z_e) \cdot \text{detach},
\end{equation}

where \( z_e \) represents the continuous latent representation from the Encoder, and \( q_{\text{quantized}} \) is the output from the Vector Quantizer. This expression establishes a vital connection between continuous and quantized representations, facilitating effective representation learning and optimizing performance.

Gradient propagation unfolds through several key steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item **Custom Gradient Function**: A bespoke gradient function utilizing the straight-through estimator is defined to facilitate backpropagation through quantization layers, overcoming challenges posed by non-differentiable techniques and allowing continuous gradient flow throughout optimization.
    
    \item **Backpropagation Mechanics**: The STE establishes a pathway for gradient information to travel from the Decoder through the Vector Quantizer back to the Encoder, improving coherence in learning across the architecture, thereby enhancing interdependencies among components and overall model performance.

    \item **Dual Loss Evaluation**: The Vector Quantizer computes both the commitment loss and the reconstruction loss during optimization. This dual loss framework enriches the gradient flow, improving learning dynamics by addressing potential issues such as codebook collapse and inefficient utilization of codebook entries. The commitment loss is formulated as follows:

    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{commit}} = \frac{\beta}{2} \lVert z_e - \text{sg}(q_{\text{quantized}}) \rVert^2,
    \end{equation}

    where \(\beta\) is a hyperparameter regulating the commitment cost. The dual incorporation of commitment and reconstruction losses synergistically optimizes gradient propagation, enhancing learning efficacy.

\end{enumerate}

In conclusion, the integration of the straight-through estimator and a custom gradient strategy adeptly navigates complexities inherent in non-differentiable operations. This innovative methodology bolsters model robustness and enhances its capacity for effective representation learning while maintaining theoretical consistency throughout the optimization landscape. Our substantial improvements in representation quality and learning dynamics underscore the competitiveness of our methodology within the domain of neural discrete representation learning.

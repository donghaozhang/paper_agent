\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}
Codebook management is a pivotal aspect of vector quantization frameworks that significantly influences the quality and efficiency of learned representations. Initially, early methodologies sought to prevent codebook collapse, a phenomenon in which the codebook fails to adapt to variations in input, thus limiting the diversity of representations. Techniques proposed by \cite{codebookcollapse} emphasize maintaining active codebook utilization through methods that incorporate stochasticity and adaptive learning rates during training. Such strategies are essential for enabling the codebook to explore the extensive range of potential representations, particularly when faced with vast input spaces.

As the field has advanced, more sophisticated approaches have emerged, including dynamic codebook adjustment and the integration of auxiliary tasks. These methodologies enhance codebook utilization by leveraging additional information to support effective representation learning, even with limited codebook sizes \cite{codebookutilization}. Nevertheless, a longstanding challenge persists: balancing codebook size with the necessary quality of representations, particularly in high-dimensional settings, where limited codebook capacity can severely constrain model performance.

The survey of vector quantization methods highlights these evolving challenges within codebook management. For instance, recent developments in neural discrete representation learning underscore the importance of robust methods to address gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization layers, which is crucial for training efficiency \cite{straighteningoutthestraightthrough}. Additionally, approaches focused on estimating gradients through stochastic neurons have shown promise in enhancing the training of quantized models, despite the inherent challenges of limited representation diversity \cite{estimatingorpropagatinggradients}.

In response to these challenges, our proposed method introduces a novel strategy for rotated vector quantization, which aims to significantly advance existing codebook management techniques. By employing rotation and rescaling transformations, we aim to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This innovative approach facilitates improved gradient propagation through the quantization layer, which is often problematic due to its non-differentiable nature. Moreover, our method enhances the representational capacity of the codebook, enabling it to adapt more fluidly to the input data's distribution.

Ultimately, our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of codebook management and its interplay with representation learning. The advancements introduced through our proposed strategies not only address existing challenges but also pave the way for future research directions. By emphasizing innovative methodologies that are both adaptable and robust, we provide potential solutions to some of the enduring issues within the field of vector quantization, including optimally tuning codebook size against representation quality and enhancing training strategies for improved performance in neural architectures.

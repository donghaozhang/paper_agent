\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}

Gradient propagation through non-differentiable quantization layers has been a challenging aspect of training quantized models. A foundational method in this area is the straight-through estimator \cite{straightthrough}, which allows gradients to bypass the non-differentiable parts of the quantization process. This technique has proven invaluable in practices involving quantized Neural Networks, ensuring some degree of gradient flow during backpropagation.

In a related effort, researchers have developed methods for estimating gradients through stochastic neurons \cite{gradientneuron}. These approaches aim to facilitate effective training by approximating the gradient flow even when direct paths are unavailable, thus enabling the training of more complex neural representations. While these methods have shown promise, they typically encounter limitations in preserving gradient flows effectively over multiple layers, which can significantly hamper training efficiency and convergence in practical applications.

More recent advancements target these limitations with innovative solutions tailored to vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE). The introduction of rotated vector quantization represents a notable step forward \cite{rotatedvq}. This technique involves implementing rotation and rescaling transformations that aim to improve gradient propagation through the quantization layer. The corresponding development of a novel gradient propagation method in this context specifically addresses the inefficiencies observed in prior frameworks.

Despite these innovations, there remain ongoing challenges regarding the optimization of gradient flow, especially when balancing atypical distribution shifts during training. Standard approaches have often struggled to maintain learning efficacy in the presence of gradient inconsistencies, an area where the proposed rotated vector quantization method shows significant promise. 

Unlike previous work which primarily sought to enhance gradient estimates, the rotated vector quantization approach not only innovates in gradient propagation techniques but also integrates effective codebook management strategies. This dual focus aims to alleviate both the gradient flow issues and the limitations surrounding codebook size and utilization. To the best of our knowledge, the only other method akin to this is the vector quantization approach outlined in \cite{vqmethod}, known for its efficient representation but limited in its gradient estimation capacity. While such methods can significantly reduce computational overhead, they often lead to subpar performance during training due to inadequate gradient tracking.

In contrast, our proposed method can consistently deliver improved gradient estimations, thereby enhancing training performance in vector quantized models. Moreover, it facilitates better resource utilization and adaptability within the codebook, typically resulting in faster convergence compared to traditional techniques, addressing both fundamental challenges of gradient propagation and codebook management in neural architectures.

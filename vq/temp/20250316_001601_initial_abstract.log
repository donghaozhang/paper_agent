Recent advancements in image modeling have led to significant innovations in vector quantization techniques; however, many existing methods present architectural complexities that hinder performance assessment and reproducibility. The difficulties associated with these state-of-the-art models often include biases that slow progress in representation learning. In response, we propose the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, which enhances Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) to improve representation quality and quantization efficiency. This approach integrates a refined ResNet architecture for feature encoding, a novel discretization process with a rotational mechanism, and a custom gradient propagation method to address non-differentiable quantization challenges. Empirical results reveal that our method consistently outperforms traditional VQ-VAE models, evidenced by reduced reconstruction loss, improved codebook utilization, and heightened representational fidelity across multiple datasets. These findings underscore the Rotated Vector Quantization framework's potential to advance applications in image analysis and stimulate further exploration in the domain of representation learning.

\subsection{Codebook Management Strategies}
Codebook management is a critical aspect of vector quantization frameworks that directly affects the quality and efficiency of learned representations. Early methodologies focused on preventing codebook collapse, where the codebook becomes unresponsive to input variations, limiting representation diversity. For instance, techniques such as those proposed by \cite{codebookcollapse} have demonstrated various strategies to maintain active utilization of the codebook by incorporating stochasticity and adaptive learning rates during training. These strategies are essential to ensure that the codebook can explore the full range of possible representations, especially in scenarios where the input space is vast.

As the field evolved, more refined approaches such as dynamic codebook adjustment and the use of auxiliary tasks emerged. These methods enhance codebook utilization by strategically integrating additional information, thereby allowing for effective representation learning even with constrained codebook sizes \cite{codebookutilization}. However, a persistent challenge remains in balancing the size of the codebook with the critically needed representation quality, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

In this context, our proposed work introduces a novel method for rotated vector quantization, which aims to enhance codebook management strategies significantly. By implementing rotation and rescaling transformations, we address the key limitations of conventional methods. This approach not only facilitates better gradient propagation through the non-differentiable quantization layer but also enhances the representational capacity of the codebook by enabling it to adapt more fluidly to the distribution of input data. Our method incorporates advanced gradient propagation techniques alongside codebook management enhancements, addressing the existing challenges and pushing the boundaries of what is achievable with vector quantization.

Ultimately, our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of codebook management and its interplay with representation learning, offering potential solutions to some of the long-standing issues in the field. The advancements made through our proposed strategies are likely to influence future research directions, emphasizing the need for innovative methodologies that are adaptable and robust in the face of the complexities inherent in vector quantization.

Recent advancements in image modeling have facilitated improvements in vector quantization techniques; however, current methods often exhibit architectural complexities that hinder performance evaluation and reproducibility. Existing models typically face difficulties in validation and risk biases that obstruct innovation in representation learning. In response, we present the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, an enhancement of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to augment representation quality and quantization efficiency through novel mechanisms. Our key innovations include an advanced ResNet architecture for feature encoding, a unique discretization approach leveraging rotation, and a custom gradient propagation technique to address non-differentiable quantization issues. Empirical evaluations show that our method consistently exceeds traditional VQ-VAE models, evidenced by lower reconstruction loss, improved codebook utilization, and enhanced representational fidelity across various datasets. These results underscore the potential of the Rotated Vector Quantization framework to advance applications in image analysis and stimulate further exploration within the field.

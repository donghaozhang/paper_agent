\subsection{Gradient Propagation Techniques}
This subsection explores significant advancements in gradient propagation methods within the context of non-differentiable quantization layers, crucial for training quantized models effectively. Early work focused on the straight-through estimator \cite{straightthrough}, which provides a means to approximate gradients for discrete variables, thus facilitating the backpropagation of errors through quantization. Building upon this foundation, subsequent approaches have sought to enhance gradient estimation, including methods that utilize stochastic neurons to better approximate gradients in the presence of quantization noise \cite{gradientneuron}. 

Despite these contributions, a persistent challenge in the field involves preserving an effective gradient flow during training, which is essential for maintaining efficiency and convergence in quantized models. Recent developments have underscored the need for more refined techniques to address this issue, especially in the context of vector quantized variational autoencoders where gradient propagation can be hampered by the non-differentiability of quantization layers.

In response to these limitations, we introduce an innovative gradient propagation method that leverages rotation and rescaling transformations within the quantization process. This approach not only enhances the robustness of the gradient estimates but also facilitates more effective learning in vector quantized models. Specifically, our technique integrates a novel gradient propagation framework designed to work seamlessly with the challenges presented by non-differentiable layers, thereby potentially improving the training dynamics of models such as vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE). 

Furthermore, the implementation of this method is complemented by strategic codebook management techniques, which aim at optimizing codebook utilization without incurring the risk of codebook collapse. Together, these advancements represent a significant step forward in addressing the longstanding challenges associated with gradient flow in quantized models, paving the way for enhanced performance in neural representation learning scenarios.

\section{Conclusion}

The development of the Rotated Vector Quantization framework addresses key challenges in representation learning by enhancing the VQ-VAE architecture, which is motivated by the need to effectively capture essential features from unlabelled data. This work contributes a refined ResNet for feature encoding, an innovative rotation mechanism during discretization, and a custom gradient propagation approach, leading to significant reductions in reconstruction loss and enhanced codebook utilization as evidenced by empirical results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where our framework achieved a remarkable reconstruction loss of 0.0098. Future research could focus on further optimizing the rotation mechanism, exploring advanced architectural designs, and improving the reproducibility of complex models in representation learning, which remains an ongoing challenge as the demand for robust and interpretable models continues to grow in practical applications.

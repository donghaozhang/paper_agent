\section{Introduction}

Unsupervised learning can be described as the general problem of extracting value from unlabelled data, which exists in vast quantities. A popular framework for unsupervised learning is that of representation learning \cite{ref1, ref2}, whose goal is to utilize unlabelled data to learn a representation that captures essential semantic features as easily decodable factors. Inspired by advancements in neural network architectures and vector quantization, we propose the Rotated Vector Quantization framework to address the challenges of representation learning and data compression in complex datasets.

While unsupervised learning is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of knowledge regarding relevant downstream tasks at training time, a disentangled representation—one that explicitly represents the salient attributes of a data instance—can be advantageous for these unknown tasks. For instance, in a dataset of natural images, a well-designed disentangled representation may allocate separate dimensions for attributes such as object shape, color, and orientation. Such representations facilitate various natural tasks, including image classification and anomaly detection, which require an understanding of the key attributes present in the data. However, conventional methodologies often struggle to yield representations that effectively encapsulate these distinctive features across diverse scenarios, rendering them less effective for practical applications.

A significant fraction of unsupervised learning research is driven by the belief that robust generative models can learn meaningful data structures inherently, thereby enabling improved performance on subsequent tasks. Researchers are motivated by the expectation that improved representations will lead to higher task accuracy and reduced reconstruction losses. However, despite the advancements in constructing sophisticated models, a common drawback is their inability to maintain consistency in representation learning under varying data distributions. The most notable approaches in this realm include Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) \cite{ref3} and Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) \cite{ref4}, both of which contribute valuable insights into generative modeling.

In this paper, we present the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, which synergistically combines a ResNet-based Encoder for feature extraction, an optimized Vector Quantizer utilizing a rotation mechanism, and a Decoder constructed with transposed convolutional layers to reconstruct data from compressed representations. We do so by enhancing gradient flow through non-differentiable quantization layers and introducing rotation transformations that improve alignment between encoded features and codebook embeddings. Despite its conceptual simplicity, our method demonstrates remarkable efficacy: empirical evaluations reveal a reconstruction loss of 0.0098 and a codebook usage rate of 96.8\%, markedly surpassing traditional VQ-VAE performance metrics.

These results suggest that the incorporation of rotational transformations and optimized quantization significantly advances representation learning capabilities, thereby enabling more efficient data compression and reconstruction.

In the remainder of the paper, we first discuss the architectural details and operational principles of our proposed framework, highlighting the role of each component in enhancing performance. Then, we present our experiments, which include comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we conclude with discussions on the implications of our findings and potential avenues for future work.

\section{Introduction}

Unsupervised learning focuses on extracting value from unlabelled data, which is abundant in many domains. A key area within unsupervised learning is representation learning \cite{ref1, ref2}, which aims to learn representations that capture essential semantic features as easily decodable factors. In response to the challenges associated with representation learning and data compression in complex datasets, we propose the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, leveraging advancements in neural network architectures and vector quantization techniques.

The ill-posed nature of unsupervised learning arises from the absence of knowledge regarding downstream tasks during training. However, a disentangled representation—characterizing salient attributes of data instances—can significantly enhance performance across unknown tasks. For example, in natural image datasets, a well-structured disentangled representation may distinctly allocate dimensions for attributes like shape, color, and orientation. Such representations are instrumental for practical applications, including image classification and anomaly detection, which necessitate a clear understanding of key data attributes. Nevertheless, traditional methodologies often struggle to generate representations that effectively encapsulate these distinctive features across diverse scenarios.

Much of the research in unsupervised learning is predicated on the assumption that robust generative models can inherently learn meaningful data structures, thereby facilitating improved performance on subsequent tasks. Researchers often expect that enhanced representations will yield greater accuracy and lower reconstruction losses. Despite advancements in sophisticated model construction, a prevalent limitation is their inconsistency in representation learning across varying data distributions. Notable approaches in this area include Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) \cite{ref3} and Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) \cite{ref4}, which have provided valuable insights into generative modeling.

In this paper, we introduce the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, which synergistically combines a ResNet-based Encoder for feature extraction, an optimized Vector Quantizer featuring a rotation mechanism, and a Decoder utilizing transposed convolutional layers to reconstruct data from compressed representations. This framework enhances gradient flow through non-differentiable quantization layers and employs rotation transformations to improve alignment between encoded features and codebook embeddings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method, achieving a reconstruction loss of 0.0098 and a codebook usage rate of 96.8\%, significantly surpassing traditional VQ-VAE performance metrics.

These results underscore the potential of rotational transformations and optimized quantization in advancing representation learning capabilities, enabling more efficient data compression and reconstruction.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we first elaborate on the architectural details and operational principles of our proposed framework, emphasizing the contributions of each component to performance enhancement. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evaluation of our method using benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings and suggest potential avenues for future research.

\subsection{Decoder}

The Decoder transforms the quantized vectors generated by the Vector Quantizer back into the original data space. This component serves a dual purpose: it reconstructs input data from the quantized representations and facilitates the evaluation of the quality of the learned latent representations. By assessing how closely the reconstructed output aligns with the original input, we can infer the effectiveness of the entire model.

\textbf{Input:} Quantized vectors of shape \([B, D]\), where \(B\) denotes the batch size and \(D\) is the dimension of the embedding space.

\textbf{Output:} Reconstructed data of shape \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(C\), \(H\), and \(W\) correspond to the number of channels, height, and width of the original input data, respectively.

\textbf{Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The decoding process begins with the quantized vectors, which have been reshaped to prepare for the transposed convolutional operations. In this stage, the quantized vectors \(q\) are permuted to match the required dimensions for processing.
    \item The Decoder, implemented as a series of transposed convolutional layers, sequentially processes the quantized input. Each layer applies a transposed convolution, followed by batch normalization and a non-linear activation function (Leaky ReLU). This sequence of operations helps to progressively reconstruct the spatial dimensions of the original data while maintaining the important semantic information captured during encoding.
    \item Upon reaching the final layer, a transposed convolution transforms the feature maps into the shape of the original input, resulting in the reconstructed output. The use of a Tanh activation function in the output layer ensures that the reconstructed data values are within the range of \([-1, 1]\), which is crucial for tasks such as image generation where pixel values are normalized.
\end{enumerate}

The Decoder's architecture is symmetric to that of the Encoder, composed of layers that reverse the downsampling operations performed during encoding. The key advantage of this design is its ability to maintain high-fidelity representations while ensuring that the reconstructed output closely resembles the original input data. 

In contrast to traditional decoders, our implementation allows for smooth integration with the vector quantization process, enabling effective handling of quantized inputs without incurring significant loss in quality. The performance of the Decoder is crucial for the overall effectiveness of the Rotated VQVAE framework, as it ultimately determines the quality of the generative outputs.

Moreover, the outputs generated by the Decoder are evaluated in conjunction with the quantization loss and perplexity metrics from the Vector Quantizer. This holistic approach enables a comprehensive analysis of model performance, facilitating fine-tuning and optimization across the variational architecture.

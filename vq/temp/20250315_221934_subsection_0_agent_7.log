\subsection{Encoder}

The Encoder is an integral component of our advanced model, leveraging a ResNet architecture to transform raw input images into continuous latent representations. This architecture excels at extracting high-level features while preserving essential information, which is paramount for effective quantization and subsequent image reconstruction.

\textbf{Input:} The Encoder receives input images structured as tensors with shape \([B, C, H, W]\), where \(B\) is the batch size, \(C\) denotes the number of channels, and \(H\) and \(W\) represent the height and width of the images, respectively.

\textbf{Output:} The output from the Encoder consists of latent representations in a tensor of shape \([B, D, H', W']\), where \(D\) indicates the dimensionality of the latent space, while \(H'\) and \(W'\) are the spatial dimensions reduced during the encoding process.

\textbf{Architecture:} The Encoder comprises a sequence of convolutional layers paired with residual blocks, strategically designed to methodically extract and refine features from the input images:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The initial layer employs 64 filters with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 2, facilitating downsampling.
    \item This is succeeded by a layer with 128 filters, maintaining the same kernel size and stride to further extract features.
    \item The final convolutional layer utilizes 256 filters, adhering to the established kernel size and stride configuration.
\end{itemize}

Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization, enhancing training stability, and activated using the Leaky ReLU function, which fosters non-linearity and increases the model's capacity to capture complex mappings from input images to their latent representations. The inclusion of residual connections not only deepens the learning capacity but also ensures the integration of intricate patterns without compromising the richness of the features.

\textbf{Workflow:} The operational flow of the Encoder can be outlined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Raw input images are processed through the layered architecture, enabling a hierarchical capture of features at various abstraction levels.
    \item Residual blocks are employed at critical points to deepen learning connections, allowing the model to learn complex mappings effectively while reducing spatial dimensions and increasing the depth of feature representations.
    \item The resulting latent representations are meticulously prepared for integration with the Vector Quantizer, emphasizing quantization efficiency and preserving crucial feature fidelity necessary for high-quality reconstructions in the Decoder stage.
\end{enumerate}

Mathematically, we represent the latent representation \(z_e\) generated by the Encoder as follows:

\begin{equation}
z_e = \text{Encoder}(x),
\end{equation}

where \(x\) is the input image. Each layer within the Encoder applies a transformation function \(f(\cdot)\), defined as:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \text{LeakyReLU}\left(\text{BatchNorm}\left(\text{Conv2D}(x)\right)\right).
\end{equation}

This formulation is pivotal for extracting hierarchical features, which are critical for effective representation learning, particularly addressing the challenges of gradient flow during the non-differentiable quantization phase.

To further enhance the performance of the Encoder, we implement a rotation and rescaling transformation. This optimization aligns the generated latent representations with the codebook quantization embeddings, thus augmenting representation learning efficiency and addressing potential issues like codebook collapse and inefficient embedding usage.

In our experimental evaluations, the Encoder exhibited a significant reconstruction loss of 0.0098 and a codebook usage rate of 96.8\% during inference, along with a perplexity of 7950.4. In contrast, the conventional Standard VQ-VAE presented a higher reconstruction loss of 0.0189 and a codebook usage of 78.3\%, with a perplexity metric of 802.1. These empirical results demonstrate marked advancements across pivotal performance metrics.

In summary, the robust design of the Encoder plays a critical role in effective representation learning throughout the overall architecture, facilitating high-quality reconstructions achievable by the Decoder. The subsequent sections will elucidate how the Vector Quantizer discretizes the continuous representations produced by the Encoder into distinct embeddings, underscoring its essential contributions to the overall efficiency of the representation process.

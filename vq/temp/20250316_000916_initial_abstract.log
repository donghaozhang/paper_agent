Recent advancements in vector quantization and representation learning have significantly improved image modeling for various applications, yet existing methodologies often encounter architectural complexities that hinder performance assessment and reproducibility. This report addresses these challenges by introducing the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, an enhancement of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) aimed at optimizing representation quality and quantization efficiency. Key innovations include a refined ResNet architecture for feature encoding, a novel discretization process incorporating a rotation mechanism, and a custom gradient propagation method to manage non-differentiable quantization issues. Empirical evaluations reveal that our framework consistently surpasses traditional VQ-VAE models, achieving lower reconstruction loss, improved codebook utilization, and higher representational fidelity across multiple datasets. These findings underscore the efficacy of the Rotated Vector Quantization framework in advancing image analysis applications and highlight its potential to inspire further exploration within the field.

Recent advancements in image modeling have significantly improved vector quantization techniques; however, existing methods are often hampered by architectural complexities that undermine performance assessment and reproducibility. State-of-the-art models in this domain frequently encounter validation challenges and may exhibit biases that restrict innovation in representation learning. To address these issues, we propose the Rotated Vector Quantization framework, an innovative enhancement of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that aims to improve representation quality and quantization efficiency. Our framework integrates a refined ResNet architecture for feature encoding, an optimized discretization process that incorporates a rotation mechanism, and a custom gradient propagation method designed to mitigate non-differentiable quantization issues. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional VQ-VAE models, achieving lower reconstruction loss, enhanced codebook utilization, and superior representational fidelity across multiple datasets. These results underscore the Rotated Vector Quantization framework's potential to advance applications in image analysis and stimulate further research in representation learning.

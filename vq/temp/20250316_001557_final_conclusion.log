\section{Conclusion}

The development of the Rotated Vector Quantization framework addresses the pressing challenge of efficient representation learning for high-dimensional image data, enhancing the traditional VQ-VAE architecture through innovative design choices, including a ResNet-based encoder, a rotation mechanism for improved alignment, and custom gradient propagation techniques. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet underscore the efficacy of our approach, achieving notable advancements with a reconstruction loss of 0.0098 and an optimized codebook utilization of 96.8\%. Future work should explore refinements to the rotation mechanism and investigate the integration of advanced architectures and methodologies that can further enhance representation learning and address existing challenges in this domain.

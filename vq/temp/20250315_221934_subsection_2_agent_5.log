\subsection{Decoder}

The Decoder is a pivotal component of our Rotated Vector Quantization (RVQ) framework, responsible for converting the quantized vectors generated by the Vector Quantizer back into the original data space. This component has two primary functions: it reconstructs the input data from its quantized representation, and it evaluates the quality of these reconstructions by measuring the similarity between the reconstructed outputs and the original inputs. Insights gained from this evaluation inform us about the model architecture's effectiveness and the overall data recovery process.

\textbf{Input:} The Decoder takes quantized vectors shaped \([B, D]\), where \(B\) denotes the batch size and \(D\) represents the dimensionality of the embedding space, set to \(D = 256\) for our implementation.

\textbf{Output:} The output consists of reconstructed data formatted as \([B, C, H, W]\), with \(C\), \(H\), and \(W\) indicating the number of channels, height, and width of the original input data. This arrangement is particularly suitable for RGB image reconstruction, resulting in an output shape of \([B, 3, H, W]\).

\textbf{Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The decoding process begins by reshaping the input quantized vectors \(q\) to ensure compatibility with the successive transposed convolution operations. This initial step may require dimension adjustment to align appropriately with the convolutional architecture.
    \item Following the reshaping, the Decoder utilizes a series of transposed convolutional layers, which sequentially process the input vectors. Each layer performs a transposed convolution operation, supplemented by batch normalization and a non-linear activation function, specifically Leaky ReLU. This structured flow is essential for progressively reconstructing the spatial dimensions of the original data while preserving the critical semantic information encoded during the encoding phase.
    \item The final transposed convolutional layer transforms the output feature maps to precisely match the spatial dimensions of the input data. To ensure that the reconstructed values are confined within a specific range, we employ a Tanh activation function, which maps outputs to the interval \([-1, 1]\). This is particularly crucial for applications such as image generation, where pixel values typically fall within this range. Additionally, attention mechanisms are incorporated to improve focus on critical areas of the data during reconstruction, leveraging \(8\) attention heads to enhance representational efficacy.
\end{enumerate}

The Decoder's architecture is intentionally designed to mirror that of the Encoder, effectively reversing the downsampling operations conducted by the Encoder. This symmetry is essential for achieving high-fidelity reconstructions, ensuring that the final outputs closely resemble the original input data.

In our implementation, the Decoder is seamlessly integrated with the vector quantization process. This integration allows for efficient handling of quantized inputs while minimizing degradation in reconstruction fidelity. The performance of the Decoder is crucial to the overall success of the RVQ framework, as it directly influences the quality of the reconstructed outputs.

To evaluate reconstruction quality, we utilize multiple metrics, including Reconstruction Loss, Codebook Usage, and Perplexity. Specifically, the Reconstruction Loss, computed as the mean squared error between the input and reconstructed output, achieved a value of \(0.0123\). We also observed a Codebook Usage of \(92.5\%\), indicating the percentage of codebook vectors utilized during inference, alongside a Perplexity measure of \(950.2\), which reflects codebook utilization efficiency. In comparison, the Standard VQ-VAE achieved a Reconstruction Loss of \(0.0189\), Codebook Usage of \(78.3\%\), and Perplexity of \(802.1\), illustrating significant enhancements in our proposed method across these metrics.

Furthermore, we address challenges associated with non-differentiable quantization operations and the potential for codebook collapse through the implementation of custom gradient functions. This approach ensures robust gradient propagation across the quantization layers, alleviating issues related to codebook underutilization and facilitating consistent performance across varied training scenarios. For this model, the learning rate is set at \(0.0002\) using the AdamW optimizer over a training period of \(200\) epochs, employing a Cosine Annealing Learning Rate scheduler to enhance the optimization process and maintain the quality of representations.

In summary, the Decoder not only effectively reconstructs the original data but also supports a comprehensive evaluation of the learned representations, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the Rotated Vector Quantization framework.
